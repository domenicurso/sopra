//! Rust-only utility (NOT a port — lives outside `src/ported/` by design).
//!
//! The DATA half of docs/BUGS.md #1090: how a backslash that is a
//! CHARACTER OF A VALUE has to be spelled before it reaches
//! `ported::pattern::patcompile`.
//!
//! C never needs this transform. Its pattern compiler consumes the
//! LEXER's encoding, where a source-level quote already arrived as
//! `Bnull`/`Bnullkeep` + payload (c:Src/zsh.h:195-200), so a RAW
//! backslash in `patcompile`'s input can only be data. A substituted
//! value acquires its pattern meaning in `zshtokenize`
//! (c:Src/glob.c:3585-3653), reached from `strcatsub`'s
//! `if (glbsub) shtokenize(dest)` (c:Src/subst.c:822/830) for
//! `${~spec}` / `GLOB_SUBST`, and that function rewrites a backslash
//! into a quote marker ONLY when the next character reaches its
//! `ztokens` scan:
//!
//! ```text
//! c:Src/glob.c:3597-3605   case Bnull: case Bnullkeep: case '\\':
//!                              if (bslash) { s[-1] = … Bnullkeep/Bnull; break; }
//!                              bslash = 1; continue;
//! c:Src/glob.c:3640-3648   for (t = ztokens; *t; t++)
//!                              if (*t == *s) {
//!                                  if (bslash) s[-1] = … Bnullkeep/Bnull;
//!                                  else *s = (t - ztokens) + Pound;
//!                                  break;
//!                              }
//! c:Src/glob.c:3651        bslash = 0;
//! ```
//!
//! Before anything else — a space, a `$`, a `{` — no `switch` arm fires,
//! c:3651 just clears `bslash`, and BOTH bytes survive in the string as
//! ordinary literal data. That is why real zsh answers
//!
//! ```text
//! p='a\ b'; [[ 'a b'  == ${~p} ]]   # no match — the pattern holds a backslash
//! p='a\ b'; [[ 'a\ b' == ${~p} ]]   # match
//! ```
//!
//! `ported::pattern`'s input normalizer (src/ported/pattern.rs, the `\\`
//! arm) reads a lone raw `\X` as a QUOTE of X — the spelling every
//! SOURCE-level pattern path in zshrs hands it (the cond/case pattern
//! builder in `extensions::compile_zsh`, `${v//\%/%%}`'s builder in
//! `ported::subst`) — and spells a literal backslash as the pair `\\`.
//! So doubling exactly the backslashes `zshtokenize` declines to consume
//! is what carries C's `Bnull`-vs-raw split into the Rust encoding.
//! Backslashes the tokenizer WOULD consume are left in place so the
//! downstream tokenizer/normalizer still folds them into a quote at
//! their original position.
//!
//! Callers are the "this pattern text came out of a VALUE" sites:
//!   * `ported::subst::paramsubst` — the search-subscript patterns
//!     (`${a[(I)…]}` / `(i)` / `(r)` / `(R)` / `(K)`), which reach
//!     `patcompile` through `tokenize` alone (c:Src/params.c:1727).
//!   * `fusevm_bridge`'s `BUILTIN_GLOB_SUBST_GUARD` /
//!     `BUILTIN_PAT_DATA_BACKSLASH` — the `${~spec}` and `setopt
//!     globsubst` legs of a `[[ … == pat ]]` RHS and a `case` arm, the
//!     `strcatsub` `shtokenize` C runs at c:Src/subst.c:822/830.
