//! `shout` — buffered terminal-output stream for the ZLE display.
//!
//! Rust-only infrastructure, not a port: it supplies the stdio buffering
//! that zsh gets for free from libc. C's display code writes every escape,
//! pad byte and glyph through `FILE *shout` (`putc`/`fputs`/
//! `tputs(..., putshout)`) and flushes ONCE per frame — `fflush(shout)` at
//! `Src/Zle/zle_refresh.c:1488` and `Src/Zle/zle_main.c:2090` — so a repaint
//! reaches the terminal as a single write.
//!
//! zshrs had no such stream: every fragment went straight to
//! `write_loop(SHTTY, …)`, one `write(2)` per escape or cell. Measured on a
//! 20-match `menu select` list (100x40 pty): zsh delivered the frame in 2 tty
//! writes, zshrs in 22+. The terminal renders each fragment as it lands, so
//! the repaint is visible as the cursor stepping across the menu.
//!
//! [`begin`]/[`end`] bracket a frame; writes inside accumulate and go out as
//! one `write_loop` when the outermost region closes. Outside a region
//! [`write`] passes through immediately, so no path that never opened a
//! region can strand output in the buffer. [`flush`] empties the buffer
//! without closing the region — the equivalent of C's `fflush(shout)`, to be
//! called before anything that blocks on the user (a key read).
