//! Startup- and shutdown-file model for every zshrs emulation drop-in.
//!
//! **zshrs-only — no zsh C counterpart.** `Src/init.c::run_init_scripts`
//! knows exactly two startup-file sets: zsh's
//! (`zshenv`/`zprofile`/`zshrc`/`zlogin`) and a single lumped Bourne one
//! (`/etc/profile` + `~/.profile` + `$ENV`). That is enough for upstream,
//! which only ever emulates `sh`/`ksh` loosely. zshrs ships drop-ins for
//! eight shells and each has its own set, so the whole table lives here.
//!
//! Every row below was read off the shell's own manual AND verified by
//! running the reference binary with a scratch `$HOME` in which each
//! candidate file echoes its own name:
//!
//! | personality | login shell | interactive non-login | non-interactive |
//! |-------------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
//! | `--bash`    | `/etc/profile`, first of `~/.bash_profile` / `~/.bash_login` / `~/.profile` | `/etc/bash.bashrc`†, `~/.bashrc` | `$BASH_ENV` |
//! | `--ksh`     | `/etc/profile`, `~/.profile`, then the interactive file | `/etc/ksh.kshrc`†, `$ENV` (default `~/.kshrc`) | — |
//! | `--mksh`    | `/etc/profile`, `~/.profile`, then the interactive file | `$ENV`, or `~/.mkshrc` when `$ENV` is unset | — |
//! | `--pdksh`   | `/etc/profile`, `~/.profile`, then the interactive file | `$ENV` (no default) | — |
//! | `--sh` / `--posix` / `--dash` / `--ash` | `/etc/profile`, `~/.profile`, then the interactive file | `$ENV` (no default) | — |
//! | `--csh`     | the non-login files, then `/etc/csh.login`, `~/.login` | `/etc/csh.cshrc`, `~/.tcshrc` or `~/.cshrc` | — |
//!
//! † existence-gated: see [`sys_file`].
//!
//! Reference runs (`printf 'true\n' | env -i HOME=… <shell> <flags>`):
//!
//! * `bash 5.3.15`: `-l -c true` → `.bash_profile`; with it removed →
//!   `.bash_login`; with both removed → `.profile`; `-i -c true` →
//!   `.bashrc`; `-i -l -c true` → `.bash_profile` and NOT `.bashrc`;
//!   `script.sh` → `$BASH_ENV`; `-l script.sh` → `.bash_profile` then
//!   `$BASH_ENV`; `-i -c true` with `$BASH_ENV` set → `.bashrc` only;
//!   `--norc -i` / `--noprofile -l` → nothing; `--rcfile F -i` and
//!   `--init-file F -i` → `F`; `-l -c exit` → `.bash_profile`,
//!   `.bash_logout`.
//! * `ksh93` (`/bin/ksh`, macOS): `-i` → `.kshrc`; `-i` with `$ENV` set →
//!   that file; `-l` → `.profile`; `-i -l` → `.profile` then `.kshrc`.
//! * `mksh 59c`: `-i` → `.mkshrc`; `-i` with `$ENV` → that file; `-l` →
//!   `.profile`; `-i -l` → `.profile` then `.mkshrc`.
//! * `dash`: `-i` → nothing without `$ENV`; `-i` with `$ENV` → that file;
//!   `-l` → `.profile`; `-i -l` with `$ENV` → `.profile` then `$ENV`.
//! * `tcsh` (macOS `/bin/csh`): `-i` → `.tcshrc`, or `.cshrc` when
//!   `.tcshrc` is absent; `-l` → `.tcshrc` then `.login`.
//!
//! pdksh itself is not installed here; its `$ENV`-with-no-default rule is
//! taken from ksh(1) on OpenBSD, which tells the user to set it by hand
//! ("`export ENV=$HOME/.kshrc`") — the sentence mksh(1) replaces with its
//! own `~/.mkshrc` fallback.
//!
//! Two deliberate divergences, both marked at their call site:
//!   * The system-wide rc files bash and ksh93 compile in (`SYS_BASHRC`,
//!     `/etc/ksh.kshrc`) are sourced when they EXIST. zshrs ships one
//!     binary to every platform and cannot bake in a packager's
//!     `-DSYS_BASHRC`; Debian/Ubuntu/Arch define it and ship the file,
//!     macOS defines neither — so "exists" reproduces both. Same
//!     reasoning as [`crate::extensions::global_rc`].
//!   * bash's `rshd`/`sshd` network-stdin case (a non-interactive shell
//!     whose stdin is a socket reads `~/.bashrc`) is not modeled.
