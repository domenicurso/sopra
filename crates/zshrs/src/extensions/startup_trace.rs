//! Startup phase timer for time-to-first-prompt work.
//!
//! **zshrs-original infrastructure — no C source counterpart.** C zsh
//! has no startup instrumentation; profiling its init means attaching
//! `dtrace`/`perf` from outside. zshrs marks its own init phases so a
//! regression in time-to-first-prompt can be attributed to a phase
//! without an external profiler.
//!
//! [`mark`] is called from the init path (`ShellExecutor::new`,
//! `ShellExecutor::exec_init`) at each phase boundary. It records the
//! elapsed time since process start and since the previous mark.
//!
//! Tracing is **off** unless `ZSHRS_STARTUP_TRACE` is set in the
//! environment, so the steady-state cost of a mark is one relaxed
//! atomic load. Per the project's "no startup chatter" rule, marks go
//! to `~/.zshrs/zshrs.log` via `tracing::info!`; setting
//! `ZSHRS_STARTUP_TRACE=stderr` additionally mirrors them to stderr,
//! which is explicit user-requested output.
