//! Global compiled-pattern cache — a zshrs-only optimization with NO C
//! counterpart, so it lives here in `src/extensions` rather than in
//! `src/ported`.
//!
//! Why it exists: C zsh recompiles a pattern on every match too, but its C
//! `patcompile` is ~40-75x faster than this Rust port. Shell code re-matches
//! identical patterns constantly — `[[ x == pat ]]`, `${(M)a:#pat}`, `case`,
//! `${x//pat/…}` — and p10k's `_p9k_param` re-matches the SAME
//! `(#b)prompt_([a-z0-9_]#)(*)` thousands of times per precmd. At the port's
//! compile cost that dominated interactive startup (the "hang before prompt").
//! Caching the compiled program turns those repeats into a hash lookup + a
//! cheap clone of the bytecode, and lets zshrs actually beat zsh here.
//!
//! Safety: the compiled `Patprog` is self-contained — matching (`pattry*`)
//! reads `prog.0.flags` / `prog.0.globflags` (never the global compile
//! statics) and borrows the prog by `&` (read-only). So a cached clone is
//! interchangeable with a freshly-compiled one.
//!
//! Correctness of the key: the compiled output depends on the pattern text,
//! `inflags`, and exactly six options — EXTENDEDGLOB/KSHGLOB/SHGLOB (which
//! shape `zpc_special` in `patcompcharsset`) and CASEGLOB/CASEPATHS/MULTIBYTE
//! (which shape `patglobflags` in `patcompstart`). All are folded into the
//! key, so any option change yields a distinct key rather than a stale hit.
//!
//! GLOBAL (not thread-local): the VM dispatches `[[ … ]]`/pattern work across
//! zshrs's worker threads, so a per-thread cache would miss on every worker.
//! A single `RwLock<HashMap>` is shared: reads (the common case, a hit) take
//! the read lock and run concurrently; only a miss's store takes the write
//! lock. The check runs BEFORE `patcompile`'s own compile mutex, so hits never
//! serialise on the compiler.
