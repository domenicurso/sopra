//! Provenance engine — value lineage across bytecode execution.
//!
//! **zshrs-original — no C zsh counterpart.** C zsh has no notion of
//! where a parameter's bytes came from; `typeset -p` shows the current
//! value and nothing about the chain of expansions, substitutions and
//! assignments that produced it. This module is the ledger that answers
//! "where did this value come from?" for a running shell.
//!
//! Ported from stryke's `strykelang/provenance.rs` (the `mark` /
//! `provenance` / `unmark` builtin trio). Three things change in the
//! shell port:
//!
//! 1. **Two key spaces instead of one.** stryke keys purely on the
//!    `Arc<HeapObject>` pointer of a value, because every stryke value
//!    stays an `Arc` from creation to use. A shell value does not: the
//!    VM/host boundary (`ShellHost::exec`, `::cmd_subst`, `::glob`)
//!    passes `String`, and the parameter table
//!    (`ported::params::assignsparam`) stores `String`, so the `Arc`
//!    identity dies at the first assignment. stryke documents that hole
//!    for its own string results ("the VM's scalar-return path re-Arcs
//!    the string"); in a shell it is the common case, not the corner
//!    case. So this port keys on three things:
//!      * `Ptr`     — `Arc` identity of an in-flight `fusevm::Value`
//!                    (`Str(Arc<String>)` / `Array(Arc<Vec<Value>>)`),
//!                    the direct stryke mechanism, valid inside a chunk.
//!      * `Name`    — a tracked parameter name; survives every
//!                    assignment/expansion round trip.
//!      * `Content` — the exact bytes of a value that crossed a
//!                    `String`-typed host boundary, so a command
//!                    substitution's output can still be recognised when
//!                    it lands in `assignsparam` a few ops later.
//! 2. **Origins are created by shell events, not by a `mark()` call on a
//!    heap object.** `$(...)`, `<(...)`, glob expansion and an explicitly
//!    tracked parameter are the origin kinds.
//! 3. **The engine is off unless armed.** `PROV_ACTIVE` is an
//!    `AtomicBool` flipped on by `provenance -m NAME` (stryke flips it in
//!    `mark`). Every hook is a single relaxed load when nobody armed it,
//!    and the whole engine can be disabled outright in
//!    `~/.zshrs/zshrs.toml` (`[provenance] enabled = false`) or with
//!    `ZSHRS_PROVENANCE=0`, in which case arming is refused and the
//!    hooks can never fire.
//!
//! Staleness handling is stryke's v1.1 design, ported as-is: a `Ptr`
//! entry stores a `Weak` alongside the raw address, and a lookup that
//! cannot upgrade the `Weak` (or upgrades it to a *different* address)
//! reaps the entry instead of reporting a lineage that belongs to a
//! long-dead allocation the allocator has since recycled.
//!
//! `Content` entries are speculative — recorded before anyone knows
//! whether the value will ever reach a tracked name — so they are
//! bounded by a FIFO of [`CONTENT_CAP`] entries. `Name` and `Ptr`
//! entries are not speculative and are only created for values that are
//! already tracked.
//!
//! Independent of the PFA-SMR recorder (`src/recorder/`): no daemon, no
//! catalog, no bundle emission. The recorder answers "what state did
//! this shell define?"; this answers "how was this value built?".
