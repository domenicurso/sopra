//! Strict-dash (Debian Almquist Shell) emulation flag — a zshrs-only
//! extension with NO zsh C counterpart.
//!
//! Upstream zsh has no `dash` personality: its option system models `sh`
//! only as a set of behavior deltas and can never *reject* a zsh syntactic
//! extension the way real dash does. dash is behaviourally `sh` for every
//! option (`shwordsplit`, `ksharrays`, `posix*`, …) and only ADDS
//! rejections of zsh-only syntax. So rather than a distinct `EMULATE_DASH`
//! bit — which would force `|| EMULATION(EMULATE_DASH)` at every one of the
//! ~25 `EMULATION(EMULATE_SH)` call sites — `emulate dash` / `zshrs --dash`
//! sets `EMULATION = EMULATE_SH` and raises this orthogonal flag.
//!
//! The lexer / parser / math / echo gates keyed off [`dash_strict`] turn
//! the following zsh extensions into the same errors real `/bin/dash`
//! produces:
//!   * `$'...'` ANSI-C quoting  → literal `$` + ordinary single quote
//!   * `<<<` here-strings       → "redirection unexpected"
//!   * `+=` compound assignment → command word ("not found")
//!   * `name=(...)` arrays       → "( unexpected" syntax error
//!   * the `[[ ]]` reserved word → ordinary command ("not found")
//!   * arith `**` / `,`          → arithmetic parse error
//!   * non-XSI `echo`            → escapes interpreted by default
//!
//! This lives in `src/extensions/` (not `src/ported/`) because it has no
//! line in zsh's C source; `src/ported/` is a faithful port only.

/// three words and the parenthesised body stays whole.  Measured:
///
/// ```text
/// $ bash -c 'a=(x "y z");            printf "<%s>" "${a[@]@A}"'
/// <declare><-a><a=([0]="x" [1]="y z")>

/// <declare -a a=([0]="x" [1]="y z")>
/// $ bash -c 'a=(x "y z"); IFS="a";   printf "<%s>" "${a[@]@A}"'
/// <decl><re ->< ><=([0]="x" [1]="y z")>
/// ```
///
/// An IFS that is unset OR empty falls back to `" \t\n"` — the empty case is
/// bash's own, and is why `IFS=""` above still splits.
///
/// A parenthesised region is protected too, which is what keeps the whole
/// `a=(…)` body one word even though its interior is full of spaces:
///
/// ```text
/// $ bash -c 'a=(x y); IFS="0"; printf "<%s>" "${a[@]@A}"'
/// <declare -a a=([0]="x" [1]="y")>          # the `0`s live inside the parens
