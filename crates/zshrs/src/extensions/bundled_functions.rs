//! Ship zsh's function tree with the binary and materialise it into
//! `~/.zshrs/functions`.
//!
//! **zshrs-original — no C counterpart.** zsh finds `is-at-least`,
//! `colors`, `add-zsh-hook`, `_git`, … through an fpath baked in by
//! `configure` (`<prefix>/share/zsh/<version>/functions`). zshrs is a
//! drop-in binary that is not installed under a zsh prefix, so it had
//! nothing of its own to fall back on: a shell started without `FPATH`
//! in the environment could not autoload anything at all, which is
//! exactly what `exec zshrs` produced --
//!
//! ```text
//! zsh: is-at-least: function definition file not found
//! zsh: colors: function definition file not found
//! zsh: add-zsh-hook: function definition file not found
//! ```
//!
//! The vendored `src/zsh/{Completion,Functions}` trees are packed by
//! `build.rs` into a single zstd blob (1245 files, ~1.1 MiB) and written
//! out here on first run, or after an upgrade, guarded by a version
//! stamp.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! FLAT, matching what zsh's own `make install` produces --
//! `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/zsh/5.9.2/share/zsh/functions` holds 1235 files
//! and zero subdirectories. Keyed by basename, so `Base/Utility/_describe`
//! and `Misc/is-at-least` both land at the top level and a plain
//! `fpath=(~/.zshrs/functions $fpath)` resolves them.
