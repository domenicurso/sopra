//! Crash-safe atomic file replacement for the rkyv shard caches.
//!
//! **zshrs-original — no C counterpart.** zsh has no persistent bytecode
//! store, so nothing here mirrors a `Src/` function.
//!
//! Both shard caches replace their file the same way: serialize into a
//! sibling temp file, `fsync`, `rename` over the target. The temp name
//! embeds the writing pid (`<file>.tmp.<pid>.<nanos>`), which is what
//! lets a later writer decide whether an abandoned temp is safe to
//! delete.
//!
//! Abandonment was not hypothetical. One `~/.zshrs` accumulated 18
//! orphaned `autoloads.rkyv.tmp.<pid>.<nanos>` files totalling 517 MB.
//! Two holes produced them, and both are closed here:
//!
//!   * an error return between `File::create` and `rename` left the temp
//!     on disk — [`TempFileGuard`] now unlinks it on every exit path,
//!     including the `?` returns and a panic;
//!   * a process killed inside that window never reached the rename at
//!     all — [`reap_orphan_temps`] unlinks temps whose recorded pid no
//!     longer exists.
//!
//! A temp owned by a **live** pid is never touched: it belongs to a
//! sibling shell that is still mid-write, and deleting it would corrupt
//! that write. Same reasoning as the `.git/index.lock` rule — a lock (or
//! a temp) you did not create is not yours to remove.
