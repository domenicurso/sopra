//! Host-registered native commands — builtins contributed by the *binary*
//! rather than by this library.
//!
//! `EXT_BUILTIN_NAMES` (`extensions/ext_builtins.rs`) and the daemon's
//! `ZSHRS_BUILTIN_NAMES` are both compile-time lists owned by this crate. A
//! fat binary that links sibling runtimes into the shell's address space —
//! `zshrs-native` links zvcs (`git`), arblang (`arb`) and strykelang
//! (`stryke`) — has no way to extend either: they are `const` arrays, and the
//! runtimes cannot be dependencies of this crate (zvcs depends on its own
//! vendored gitoxide by path, which makes any dependent unpublishable).
//!
//! So the binary registers them here, once, before the shell starts. A
//! registered name dispatches in-process on a direct function call: no fork,
//! no execve, no `PATH` walk, no dynamic loader — the same treatment `cat` and
//! `sort` already get from `reg_overridable!`.
//!
//! # Dispatch order
//!
//! Registration does not jump the queue. zsh resolves a command word as
//! alias → function → builtin → external (c:Src/exec.c:3038-3068), and a
//! native command sits in the *builtin* slot, after the ported builtin table:
//!
//! * a user `git() { … }` still wins, exactly as it shadows `cat` today;
//! * `command git` still reaches whatever `git` is on `PATH`, because the
//!   forced-external path never consults this registry;
//! * `builtin git` reaches the native one.
//!
//! # Registration is one-shot and start-up only
//!
//! The table is written once by the binary's `main` before the shell runs and
//! is read from every command dispatch after that, including from the worker
//! threads. It is therefore an `RwLock` whose write side is expected to be
//! uncontended: registering after startup is allowed but pointless, and no
//! path ever removes an entry — a name that answered `whence -w` one moment
//! must not vanish the next.
