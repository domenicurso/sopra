//! zsh's man and info pages, shipped inside the binary.
//!
//! **zshrs-original infrastructure — no C source counterpart.** zsh's
//! `make install` drops `zsh.1`, `zshall.1`, `zshbuiltins.1` … under
//! `<prefix>/share/man/man1` and `zsh.info*` under `<prefix>/share/info`,
//! and `man`/`info` find them because that prefix is already on the
//! system's search path.
//!
//! zshrs is a drop-in binary that is not installed under a zsh prefix, so
//! `man zshall` and `info zsh` worked only on a host that happened to have
//! zsh installed — while the pages document the language zshrs itself
//! implements. `build.rs` packs `vendor/zsh-doc` into the binary and this
//! module writes it to `~/.zshrs/{man,info}` on first run, then puts those
//! directories on `MANPATH` / `INFOPATH`.
//!
//! Both variables are extended, never replaced: an empty trailing entry is
//! how `man` and `info` are told "and then your usual search path", so a
//! shell that had no `MANPATH` still finds every other page on the system.
//!
//! Errors are swallowed on purpose, as in [`crate::bundled_functions`]: a
//! read-only or full `$HOME` must not stop the shell from starting.
