//! Keep the shell's own file descriptors out of the user's fd space.
//!
//! zsh routes every internal open through `movefd()` (Src/utils.c:1975), which
//! relocates the descriptor to >= 10 with `fcntl(fd, F_DUPFD, 10)` and records
//! it as `FDT_INTERNAL`. The point is that fds 0-9 belong to the SCRIPT: `exec
//! 3>out`, `read -u 4`, `print -u 3` and friends address them by number, and a
//! shell that parks its own state there is squatting on the user's namespace.
//!
//! zshrs was squatting. A `-c` run held:
//!
//!     fd 3 -> ~/.zshrs/zshrs.log
//!     fd 4 -> ~/.zshrs/zshrs_history.db          (sqlite)
//!     fd 5,6,7 -> ~/.zshrs/compsys.db + -wal + -shm
//!
//! so `print -u 3 -r -- x` appended `x` to the shell's own LOG and reported
//! success (zsh: `bad file number: 3`, status 1), and `exec 3>myfile` would
//! dup2 over the log handle — `exec 4>myfile` over the live sqlite handle.
//!
//! `movefd` only works for a descriptor we own and can close. sqlite caches the
//! fd number inside the connection, so it cannot be relocated after the fact.
//! The fix therefore has to make the open LAND high: hold every low fd for the
//! duration of the open, so the kernel's "lowest free descriptor" rule hands out
//! >= 10, then release. That covers lazily-opened descriptors (sqlite's WAL and
//! SHM appear on first use) as long as the open happens inside the guard.
//!
//! # Concurrency and fork
//!
//! Unlike C zsh, zshrs runs the guard off the main thread: `compinit` ships its
//! cache rebuild to the worker pool, and that task calls
//! [`crate::compsys::cache::CompsysCache::open`] while the main thread is still
//! sourcing the user's rc files. So the guard MUST be safe against concurrent
//! opens in other threads.
//!
//! It is made safe without any lock. Every descriptor the guard owns is obtained
//! from `fcntl(F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC)`, which allocates the lowest free descriptor as a
//! single atomic kernel operation — two threads racing get two distinct fds, and
//! the guard never names, and therefore never clobbers, a descriptor somebody
//! else owns.
//!
//! Lock-freedom is not an optimization here, it is a correctness requirement:
//! `fork(2)` is called directly in `fusevm_bridge.rs` and `ported/exec.rs`, and
//! only the forking thread survives into the child. A mutex held by any other
//! thread at that moment is inherited permanently locked, so a guard that
//! serialized on one would deadlock the first `LowFdGuard::new()` in the child.
//! Raw fd syscalls have no such hazard: the child inherits the fd table and the
//! guard behaves identically there.
//!
//! `F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC` also means the reserved slots do not leak through an
//! `exec(2)` that races the guard — the old `dup2` path cleared `FD_CLOEXEC` on
//! its targets, so a child could start life with `/dev/null` parked on fds 3-9.
