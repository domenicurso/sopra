//! Extension-only shell builtins (no zsh C counterpart).
//!
//! Every method here implements a builtin that does NOT exist in
//! `src/zsh/Src/` — these are zshrs-specific additions: coreutils
//! drop-ins, bash-only builtins (caller, shopt, readarray), zshrs
//! features (async, await, barrier, doctor, profile, intercept),
//! contrib autoloads exposed as builtins (compdef, compinit, zmv,
//! zcalc, peach), etc.
//!
//! These methods previously lived on `ShellExecutor` in
//! `src/ported/vm_helper`. They were bulk-moved here so that
//! `src/ported/` only contains C-port code, satisfying the
//! `port_purity` discipline described in `docs/PORT.md`.
