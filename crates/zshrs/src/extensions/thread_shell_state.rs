//! Per-thread storage for the shell state C keeps per THREAD OF EXECUTION.
//!
//! **zshrs-original infrastructure — no `Src/*.c` counterpart.** It is the
//! generalisation of [`crate::errflag_cell`], and it exists for the same
//! reason: zshrs replaced a `fork(2)` with a thread.
//!
//! C zsh runs on one thread. `scriptname` (`Src/init.c`, the diagnostic
//! prefix `zwarning` reads at `Src/utils.c:147`), `funcstack`
//! (`Src/exec.c:340`, behind `$funcstack` / `$functrace` /
//! `$funcfiletrace` / `$funcsourcetrace`), `zsh_eval_context`
//! (`zsh.export:355`, behind `$ZSH_EVAL_CONTEXT`) and `locallevel`
//! (`Src/params.c:54`) are all plain globals that describe WHERE THE ONE
//! THREAD CURRENTLY IS. Background work in C is a forked child, so the
//! child's pushes onto those globals are invisible to the parent.
//!
//! zshrs runs some of that work on the worker pool ([`crate::worker`])
//! instead — `async_precmd` (`crate::async_precmd`) hands hook FUNCTIONS to
//! a worker, and `compsys::in_editor` drives the completer tree on a
//! dedicated thread. A hook function moves every one of those globals while
//! it runs, and the shell thread reads the moved value:
//!
//! ```text
//! async_precmd_functions=(spin_hook)   # spin_hook is running on a worker
//! % done                               # typed at the prompt
//! spin_hook:4: parse error near `done'     <- zshrs, before this module
//! zsh: parse error near `done'             <- zsh
//! ```
//!
//! The user is pointed at a function that has nothing to do with what they
//! typed, which is worse than no information at all. `quiesce`
//! (`crate::async_precmd::quiesce`) closes the window where the shell
//! thread EXECUTES shell code during a batch, but the line above is
//! diagnosed by the LEXER, which runs before the `quiesce()` in
//! `init::loop_` — and `quiesce` is a serialisation, not a fix for the
//! sharing.
//!
//! Restoring the C model is the fix: the shell thread keeps the
//! process-wide value, every other thread gets its own. A thread that runs
//! shell code off the shell thread IS a forked child in the C design, so
//! where it is stays with it.
//!
//! Two shapes live here:
//!
//! * [`ThreadMutex`] for the stack-shaped state (`scriptname`,
//!   `scriptfilename`, `funcstack`, `zsh_eval_context`). It mirrors
//!   `Mutex`'s `lock()` / `clear_poison()` so the ~50 existing
//!   `FUNCSTACK.lock()` call sites read exactly as they did before.
//! * [`LocalLevelCell`] for `locallevel`, which cannot simply become
//!   per-thread — see its own docs.
