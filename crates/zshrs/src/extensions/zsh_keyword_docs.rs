It can be enabled\nwith the command \"enable -r repeat\""),
    ("case", "Execute the _list_ associated with the first _pattern_\nthat matches _word_, if any.  The form of the patterns\nis the same as that used for filename generation.  See\n_Filename Generation_ (zshexpn).\n\nNote further that, unless the `SH_GLOB` option is set, the whole\npattern with alternatives is treated by the shell as equivalent to a\ngroup of patterns within parentheses, although white space may appear\nabout the parentheses and the vertical bar and will be stripped from the\npattern at those points.  White space may appear elsewhere in the\npattern; this is not stripped.  If the `SH_GLOB` option is set, so\nthat an opening parenthesis can be unambiguously treated as part of the\ncase syntax, the expression is parsed into separate words and these are\ntreated as strict alternatives (as in other shells).\n\nIf the _list_ that is executed is terminated with `;&` rather than\n`;;`, the following list is also executed.  The rule for\nthe terminator of the following list `;;`, `;&` or `;|` is\napplied unless the `esac` is reached.\n\nIf the _list_ that is executed is terminated with `;|` the\nshell continues to scan the _pattern_s looking for the next match,\nexecuting the corresponding _list_, and applying the rule for\nthe corresponding terminator `;;`, `;&` or `;|`.\nNote that _word_ is not re-expanded; all applicable _pattern_s\nare tested with the same _word_."),

    ("LPAR", "Execute _list_ in a subshell.  Traps set by the `trap` builtin\nare reset to their default values while executing _list_; an\nexception is that ignored signals will continue to be ignored\nif the option `POSIXTRAPS` is set."),
    ("always", "First execute _try-list_.  Regardless of errors, or `break` or\n`continue` commands encountered within _try-list_,\nexecute _always-list_.  Execution then continues from the\nresult of the execution of _try-list_; in other words, any error,\nor `break` or `continue` command is treated in the\nnormal way, as if _always-list_ were not present.  The two\nchunks of code are referred to as the \"try block\" and the \"always block\".\n\nOptional newlines or semicolons may appear after the `always`;\nnote, however, that they may _not_ appear between the preceding\nclosing brace and the `always`.\n\nAn \"error\" in this context is a condition such as a syntax error which\ncauses the shell to abort execution of the current function, script, or\nlist.  Syntax errors encountered while the shell is parsing the\ncode do not cause the _always-list_ to be executed.  For example,\nan erroneously constructed `if` block in _try-list_ would cause the\nshell to abort during parsing, so that _always-list_ would not be\nexecuted, while an erroneous substitution such as `${*foo*}` would\ncause a run-time error, after which _always-list_ would be executed.\n\nAn error condition can be tested and reset with the special integer\nvariable `TRY_BLOCK_ERROR`.  Outside an _always-list_ the value is\nirrelevant, but it is initialised to `-1`.  Inside _always-list_, the\nvalue is 1 if an error occurred in the _try-list_, else 0.  If\n`TRY_BLOCK_ERROR` is set to 0 during the _always-list_, the error\ncondition caused by the _try-list_ is reset, and shell execution\ncontinues normally after the end of _always-list_.  Altering the value\nduring the _try-list_ is not useful (unless this forms part of an\nenclosing `always` block).\n\nRegardless of `TRY_BLOCK_ERROR`, after the end of _always-list_ the\nnormal shell status `$?` is the value returned from _try-list_.\nThis will be non-zero if there was an error, even if `TRY_BLOCK_ERROR`\nwas set to zero.\n\nThe following executes the given code, ignoring any errors it causes.\nThis is an alternative to the usual convention of protecting code by\nexecuting it in a subshell.\n\nexample({\n    # code which may cause an error\n  } always {\n    # This code is executed regardless of the error.\n    (( TRY_BLOCK_ERROR = 0 ))\n}\n# The error condition has been reset.)\n\nWhen a `try` block occurs outside of any function,\na `return` or a `exit` encountered in _try-list_ does _not_ cause\nthe execution of _always-list_.  Instead, the shell exits immediately\nafter any `EXIT` trap has been executed.\nOtherwise, a `return` command encountered in _try-list_ will cause the\nexecution of _always-list_, just like `break` and `continue`.\n\nCOMMENT(The semantics of calling 'exit' in try-list inside a function are\ndeliberately left unspecified, because historically there was a mismatch between\nthe documented and implemented behaviours.  Cf. 20076, 21734/21735, 45075.)"),
    ("function", "where _term_ is one or more newline or `;`.\nDefine a function which is referenced by any one of _word_.\nNormally, only one _word_ is provided; multiple _word_s\nare usually only useful for setting traps.\nThe body of the function is the _list_ between\nthe `{` and `}`.  See _Functions_ (blow).\n\nThe options of `function` have the following meanings:\n\n\n- **-T** — Enable tracing for this function, as though with `functions -T`.  See the\ndocumentation of the `-f` option to the `typeset` builtin, in\n_Shell Builtin Commands_ (zshbuiltins).\n\n\nIf the option `SH_GLOB` is set for compatibility with other shells, then\nwhitespace may appear between the left and right parentheses when\nthere is a single _word_;  otherwise, the parentheses will be treated as\nforming a globbing pattern in that case.\n\nIn any of the forms above, a redirection may appear outside the\nfunction body, for example\n\nexample(func+() { ... } 2>&1)\n\nThe redirection is stored with the function and applied whenever the\nfunction is executed.  Any variables in the redirection are expanded\nat the point the function is executed, but outside the function scope."),
    ("time", "The _pipeline_ is executed, and timing statistics are\nreported on the standard error in the form specified\nby the `TIMEFMT` parameter.\nIf _pipeline_ is omitted, print statistics about the\nshell process and its children."),
    ("[[", "Evaluates the conditional expression _exp_\nand return a zero exit status if it is true.\nSee _Conditional Expressions_ (below)\nfor a description of _exp_."),
    ("if", "An alternate form of `if`.  The rules mean that\n\n    if [[ -o ignorebraces ]] {\n  print yes\n}\n\nworks, but\n\n    if true {  # Does not work!\n  print yes\n}\n\ndoes _not_, since the test is not suitably delimited."),
