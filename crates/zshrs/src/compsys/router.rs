//! Compsys backend router — Rust ports vs upstream shell functions.
//!
//! **zshrs-original — no C source counterpart.** C zsh has only one
//! compsys backend: the shell-function tree at `Completion/`,
//! autoloaded via `fpath`. zshrs ships a parallel Rust-port tree
//! under `src/compsys/ported/` whose entry points are reachable
//! through this router.
//!
//! The user picks per-machine via `~/.config/zshrs/config.toml`:
//! ```toml
//! [compsys]
//! backend = "rust"   # default — route _NAME calls to compsys::ported
//! # backend = "shell"  # bypass — let standard shfunc dispatch win
//! ```
//!
//! `try_rust_dispatch(name, args)` returns `Some(rc)` when the Rust
//! backend handled the call; `None` to defer to the regular shfunc
//! path (the standard zsh-compatible chain).

    // the right RATIO measured over a subset; a later correction replaced it
    // with the 318 figure, which is real but is the distance to a release this
    // shell never runs.
    //
    // The measurement hazard that correction identified is REAL, and survives
    // in a sharper form: a fixture that pins
    // `fpath=( /usr/share/zsh/5.9/functions )` makes the two shells run
    // completers from DIFFERENT zsh releases, because zshrs substitutes the
    // bundle (upstream-tracking) while zsh reads Apple's 5.9. Any cell landing
    // on one of those 318 then fails for reasons unrelated to the engine — a
    // 99-cell sweep on 2026-09-09 had all 5 failures from exactly that split
    // (`cp -`, where the bundle's `_cp` adds `darwin` to the `-l`/`-x`/`-s`
    // OSTYPE patterns and adds `-c`; plus `ansible --`, `ansible -a `, `cut -`,
    // `date -`). The fix is to pin the CELLAR 5.9.2 tree, not Apple's, where
    // the two sides agree on 1234 of 1235 files.
    //
    // Without this arm nothing on `$fpath` could ever match the
    // `/share/zsh/` string test, so `stock_pos` below was ALWAYS `None` and
    // every ported `_NAME` the bundle carries was misread as a user override:
    // `try_rust_dispatch` returned None and 244 of 249 ports stood down. The
    // default `[compsys] backend = "rust"` was inert on any real host.
    //
    // Measured A/B over 306 comparable cells, only the backend flipped:
    //   backend=shell  PASS=275 FAIL=19 TIMEOUT=7
    //   backend=rust   PASS=286 FAIL=13 TIMEOUT=2
    // 12 cases better, 1 worse (`CC -`), and no utility function worse on the
