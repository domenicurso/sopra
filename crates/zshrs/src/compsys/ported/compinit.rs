//! sh:  1  # Initialisation for new style completion. This mainly contains some helper
//! sh:  2  # functions and setup. Everything else is split into different files that
//! sh:  3  # will automatically be made autoloaded (see the end of this file).  The
//! sh:  4  # names of the files that will be considered for autoloading are those that
//! sh:  5  # begin with an underscores (like `_condition).
//! sh:  6  #
//! sh:  7  # The first line of each of these files is read and must indicate what
//! sh:  8  # should be done with its contents:
//! sh:  9  #
//! sh: 10  #   `#compdef <names ...>'
//! sh: 11  #     If the first line looks like this, the file is autoloaded as a
//! sh: 12  #     function and that function will be called to generate the matches
//! sh: 13  #     when completing for one of the commands whose <names> are given.
//! sh: 14  #     The names may also be interspersed with `-T <assoc>' options
//! sh: 15  #     specifying for which set of functions this should be added.
//! sh: 16  #
//! sh: 17  #   `#compdef -[pP] <patterns ...>'
//! sh: 18  #     This defines a function that should be called to generate matches
//! sh: 19  #     for commands whose name matches <pattern>. Note that only one pattern
//! sh: 20  #     may be given.
//! sh: 21  #
//! sh: 22  #   `#compdef -k <style> [ <key-sequence> ... ]'
//! sh: 23  #     This is used to bind special completions to all the given
//! sh: 24  #     <key-sequence>(s). The <style> is the name of one of the built-in
//! sh: 25  #     completion widgets (complete-word, delete-char-or-list,
//! sh: 26  #     expand-or-complete, expand-or-complete-prefix, list-choices,
//! sh: 27  #     menu-complete, menu-expand-or-complete, or reverse-menu-complete).
//! sh: 28  #     This creates a widget behaving like <style> so that the
//! sh: 29  #     completions are chosen as given in the rest of the file,
//! sh: 30  #     rather than by the context.  The widget has the same name as
//! sh: 31  #     the autoload file and can be bound using bindkey in the normal way.
//! sh: 32  #
//! sh: 33  #   `#compdef -K <widget-name> <style> <key-sequence> [ ... ]'
//! sh: 34  #     This is similar to -k, except it takes any number of sets of
//! sh: 35  #     three arguments.  In each set, the widget <widget-name> will
//! sh: 36  #     be defined, which will behave as <style>, as with -k, and will
//! sh: 37  #     be bound to <key-sequence>, exactly one of which must be defined.
//! sh: 38  #     <widget-name> must be different for each:  this must begin with an
//! sh: 39  #     underscore, else one will be added, and should not clash with other
//! sh: 40  #     completion widgets (names based on the name of the function are the
//! sh: 41  #     clearest), but is otherwise arbitrary.  It can be tested in the
//! sh: 42  #     function by the parameter $WIDGET.
//! sh: 43  #
//! sh: 44  #   `#autoload [ <options> ]'
//! sh: 45  #     This is for helper functions that are not used to
//! sh: 46  #     generate matches, but should automatically be loaded
//! sh: 47  #     when they are called. The <options> will be given to the
//! sh: 48  #     autoload builtin when making the function autoloaded. Note
//! sh: 49  #     that this need not include `-U' and `-z'.
//! sh: 50  #
//! sh: 51  # Note that no white space is allowed between the `#' and the rest of
//! sh: 52  # the string.
//! sh: 53  #
//! sh: 54  # Functions that are used to generate matches should return zero if they
//! sh: 55  # were able to add matches and non-zero otherwise.
//! sh: 56  #
//! sh: 57  # See the file `compdump' for how to speed up initialisation.
//! sh: 58
//! sh: 59  # If we got the `-d'-flag, we will automatically dump the new state (at
//! sh: 60  # the end).  This takes the dumpfile as an argument.  -d (with the
//! sh: 61  # default dumpfile) is now the default; to turn off dumping use -D.
//! sh: 62
//! sh: 63  # If the dumpfile is being regenerated and you don't know why, you can use
//! sh: 64  # the -w flag to see if it was because -D was passed, zsh version mismatched,
//! sh: 65  # or number of files in $fpath differed.
//! sh: 66
//! sh: 67  # The -C flag bypasses both the check for rebuilding the dump file and the
//! sh: 68  # usual call to compaudit; the -i flag causes insecure directories found by
//! sh: 69  # compaudit to be ignored, and the -u flag causes all directories found by
//! sh: 70  # compaudit to be used (without security checking).  Otherwise the user is
//! sh: 71  # queried for whether to use or ignore the insecure directories (which
//! sh: 72  # means compinit should not be called from non-interactive shells).

//! sh:208  # defined. The arguments after the function name are then interpreted as
//! sh:209  # the names of the command for which the function generates matches.
//! sh:210  # With the `-p' option a function for a name pattern is defined. This
//! sh:211  # function will be invoked when completing for a command whose name
//! sh:212  # matches the pattern given as argument after the function name (in this
//! sh:213  # case only one argument is accepted).
//! sh:214  # The option `-P' is like `-p', but the function will be called after
//! sh:215  # trying to find a function defined for the command on the line if no
//! sh:216  # such function could be found.
//! sh:217  # With the `-k' option a function for a special completion keys is
//! sh:218  # defined and immediately bound to those keys. Here, the extra arguments
//! sh:219  # are the name of one of the builtin completion widgets and any number
//! sh:220  # of key specifications as accepted by the `bindkey' builtin.
//! sh:221  # In any case the `-a' option may be given which makes the function
//! sh:222  # whose name is given as the first argument be autoloaded. When defining
//! sh:223  # a function for command names the `-n' option may be given and keeps
//! sh:224  # the definitions from overriding any previous definitions for the
//! sh:225  # commands; with `-k', the `-n' option prevents compdef from rebinding
//! sh:226  # a key sequence which is already bound.
//! sh:227  # For deleting definitions, the `-d' option must be given. Without the
//! sh:228  # `-p' option, this deletes definitions for functions for the commands
//! sh:229  # whose names are given as arguments. If combined with the `-p' option
//! sh:230  # it deletes the definitions for the patterns given as argument.
//! sh:231  # The `-d' option may not be combined with the `-k' option, i.e.
//! sh:232  # definitions for key function can not be removed.

//! sh:235  #
//! sh:236  #  compdef -a foo bar baz
//! sh:237  #    make the completion for the commands `bar' and `baz' use the
