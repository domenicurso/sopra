//! zsh wiring for inline Rust FFI (`rust { ... }` blocks).
//!
//! fusevm does the heavy lifting: [`fusevm::RustSugar`] rewrites the block at
//! the source level and [`fusevm::ffi`] compiles/loads/marshals it. This module
//! only supplies the zsh-flavored [`fusevm::RustSugar`] config and the desugar
//! entry the parser calls before lexing. The emitted `__rust_compile` command
//! and every exported bareword are resolved elsewhere:
//!
//! - `__rust_compile` is a zshrs builtin (`bin_rust_compile`, src/ported/
//!   builtin.rs) that calls [`fusevm::ffi::compile_and_register`].
//! - An exported name runs as a command via the FFI fallback in
//!   `ShellExecutor::try_registered_ffi_command` (src/vm_helper.rs), consulted
//!   only after builtins/functions/`$PATH`/`command_not_found_handler` all miss
//!   — real commands keep priority.
