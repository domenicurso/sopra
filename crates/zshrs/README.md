### `[THE FIRST JIT-COMPILED UNIX SHELL]`

> *"No fork, no problems."*

The first Unix shell to JIT-compile to native machine code. Bytecode alone is no longer a first: Nushell's IR compiler and evaluator landed in 0.96.0 and became its default evaluator in 0.98.0 — but that IR is interpreted, compiled per parse, and discarded at process exit. zshrs compiles every command (interactive, script, function, sourced file) to fusevm bytecode with fused superinstructions, hands hot blocks to a tiered Cranelift JIT that emits x86-64/aarch64 machine code, and persists the bytecode across processes in rkyv images. No shell before it ran shell source as native code. A drop-in zsh replacement written in Rust — **915k lines, 861 source files** across a 4-crate workspace (`zshrs` runtime + `zshrs-daemon` + `znative`, the published plugin-ABI SDK, + `zshrs-runtime`, a 16-line crate whose only job is to emit `libzsh.a` for AOT linking without making `cargo install zshrs` build it; `compsys` was folded into the runtime), with the runtime split into a **strict 1:1 port directory** (`src/ported/` — 106 files, every fn maps to a real `Src/<x>.c` zsh function, enforced by `tests/port_purity.rs`), **a non-port extensions directory** (`src/extensions/` — 102 files, features zsh C does not have: AOT, daemon coordination, plugin/script/autoload caches, native fish-ported ZLE engines (syntax highlight, autosuggest, history search, autopair — ON by default in any shell that reads rc files, refused when `RCS` is unset so bare `zshrs -f` stays byte-identical to `zsh -f`; per-feature `false` in `[zle]` of `~/.zshrs/zshrs.toml` opts out), persistent worker pools, ZWC byte-code helpers), and a feature-gated recorder (`src/recorder/`). **193 ZLE widgets registered** in `IWIDGET_NAMES` (history navigation, vi find/repeat/marks, undo/redo, isearch, yank-pop, shell-aware word motion, region/visual mode, text objects, completion menu, $zle_highlight parsing), 47 fish-ported builtins, persistent worker pool, AOP intercept, **rkyv**-backed bytecode images (mmap hot path; the only persisted shell bytecode cache — zsh's `.zwc` is wordcode for zsh's own interpreter, Nushell's IR never leaves the process), **read-only SQLite mirrors** beside them for `dbview` / SQL inspection only (no cache semantics), and full zsh compatibility. Also **the first shell to expose its native-plugin interface as a stable, versioned, independently-published ABI** — third parties `cargo add znative`, ship a `cdylib`, and load it at runtime via `zmodload -R` (version-gated, mismatches refused). bash `enable -f` and zsh `zmodload` load native code too, but only compiled against the shell's private internal headers, welded to one build with no stable ABI; see [`docs/PLUGINS.md`](docs/PLUGINS.md). Also **the first shell in the Bourne lineage to ship a language server and a debug adapter in its own binary** — `zshrs --lsp` and `zshrs --dap`; Nushell (`nu --lsp`) and Elvish (`elvish -lsp`) got there first outside that lineage, but bash, zsh, ksh, dash and fish have neither, and their editor tooling (`bash-language-server`, `fish-lsp`, `vscode-bash-debug`) lives in separate Node/TypeScript projects that re-derive a parser the shell already has; zshrs's server answers from the shell's own lexer, parser and live compsys completers. And through its companion build [`zshrs-native`](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/zshrs-native), **the first shell with a version control system compiled into it** — `git` served natively as a builtin in the shell's own process, no fork, no exec, no PATH lookup. Since the Bourne shell in 1970 every Unix shell has run git as a foreign binary; BusyBox has no git applet, Nushell's `gstat` plugin is status-only and runs as a separate child process, and `git-shell` execs real git. The same build is also **the first shell with an fzf-compatible finder compiled in** — `arb --fzf` honors `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`, `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE` and fzf's flag surface in-process, where zsh's key bindings, fzf-tab, fzf.fish and PSFzf all spawn the fzf binary. Elvish is the nearest miss: its histlist and location modes are real in-process fuzzy filtering, but they are shell-internal UI, not a finder that can filter a pipeline.

## [0x00] OVERVIEW

zshrs replaces `fork + exec` with a persistent worker thread pool, compiles every command to [fusevm](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/fusevm) bytecodes, and **persists compiled chunks only in rkyv shards** under `~/.zshrs/images/` (single-directory rule — every zshrs file lives under `$ZSHRS_HOME` / `~/.zshrs/`; see [`docs/DAEMON.md`](docs/DAEMON.md)). Beside that tree, **`catalog.db` and related SQL views are read-only mirrors** for inspection (`dbview`, ad-hoc SQL): daemon-hydrated, **never authoritative for cache hit/miss or execution**. They are not a second shell cache. **`history.db`** holds history only — it is unrelated to bytecode caching. The result: shell startup, command dispatch, globbing, completion, and autoloading are all faster by orders of magnitude.

The **8 Bourne-family dialects** are the emulation drop-ins `--zsh`, `--bash`, `--ksh`, `--mksh`, `--pdksh`, `--sh`/`--posix`, `--dash`, and `--ash` (the C-shell `--csh` mode is separate). All eight compile through the same fusevm core, and each is verified against its **real reference shell** by the parity matrix in [`tests/emulation_parity.rs`](tests/emulation_parity.rs). zsh mode is additionally cross-checked against real `zsh` by a **differential fuzz harness** ([`bins/parity-fuzz.rs`](bins/parity-fuzz.rs)) that runs thousands of grammar-driven, seed-replayable snippets through both shells and flags any stdout/exit divergence.

## [0x02] NO-FORK ARCHITECTURE

Every operation that zsh forks for runs in-process. **Zero forks for builtins.**

| Operation | zsh | zshrs |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| `$(cmd)` | fork + pipe | In-process stdout capture via `dup2` |
| `<(cmd)` / `>(cmd)` | fork + FIFO | Worker pool thread + FIFO |
| `cat file` | fork + exec /bin/cat | **Builtin** — zero fork |
| `head`/`tail`/`wc` | fork + exec | **Builtin** — zero fork |
| `sort`/`find`/`uniq` | fork + exec | **Builtin** — zero fork |
| `date`/`hostname`/`uname` | fork + exec | **Builtin** — direct syscall |
| `sleep`/`mktemp`/`touch` | fork + exec | **Builtin** — zero fork |
| `xattr` operations | fork + exec xattr | **Direct syscall** — zero fork |
| `pmap`/`pgrep`/`peach` | fork N times | **VM execution** — zero fork |
| `git` (via [`zshrs-native`](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/zshrs-native)) | fork + exec /usr/bin/git | **Builtin** — zvcs linked in, zero fork |
| `fzf` (via [`zshrs-native`](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/zshrs-native)) | fork + exec the fzf binary | **Builtin** — arb's finder linked in, zero fork |
| `**/*.rs` | Single-threaded `opendir` | Parallel `walkdir` per-subdir on pool |
| `*(.x)` qualifiers | N serial `stat` calls | One parallel metadata prefetch |
| `rehash` | Serial `readdir` per PATH dir | Parallel scan across pool |
| `compinit` | Synchronous fpath scan | Background fpath scan on the worker pool |
| History write | Synchronous `fsync` | Fire-and-forget to pool |
| Autoload | Read file + parse every time | Bytecode mmap + zero-copy load from **rkyv** |
| Plugin source | Parse + execute every startup | Delta replay from **rkyv** image |

### Coreutils Builtins (Anti-Fork)

23 coreutils commands run in-process with zero fork overhead:

```
cat  head  tail  wc  sort  find  uniq  cut  tr  seq  rev  tee
basename  dirname  touch  realpath  sleep  whoami  id  hostname
uname  date  mktemp
```

**Speedup: 2000-5000x** per invocation (2-5ms fork overhead → 0.001ms builtin call).

---

## [0x03] BYTECODE COMPILATION

Every command compiles to [fusevm](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/fusevm) bytecodes via a faithful port of zsh's lexer + parser:

```
Interactive command  ──► lex::zshlex ──► parse::parse ──► ZshCompiler ──► fusevm::Op ──► VM::run()
                         (port of    (port of      (original;
                          Src/lex.c)  Src/parse.c)  ~10.6k LOC)
Script file (first)  ──► lex::zshlex ──► parse::parse ──► ZshCompiler ──► VM::run() ──► persist rkyv shard
Script file (cached) ──► index.rkyv + mmap shard ──► deserialize Chunk ──► VM::run()
                         (no lex, no parse, no compile)
Autoload function    ──► autoloads.rkyv ──► deserialize Chunk ──► VM::run()
                         (first call in a process compiles the definition
                          file and writes the chunk through; later processes
                          skip lex+parse+compile entirely. Each entry is
                          stamped with the definition file's mtime + length,
                          so an edited function recompiles.)
```

Measured on `_git` (424 KB of shell, the largest completer in common use):
first `git <tab>` in a process **1.06 s → 0.56 s** once the chunk is
cached, and decoding that cached 4.6 MB chunk costs **229 µs** against
**318 ms** to parse + compile the file. The cache is bypassed for
`ksh_autoload`-style bodies and for `autoload` without `-U`, where the
compiled program is not a function of the file's bytes alone.

The write-through fills one entry per function actually called. To
compile the whole corpus up front — so the FIRST `ls -<TAB>` of a fresh
install is already an O(1) shard probe:

```zsh
zshrs --prewarm-autoloads            # every dir on $fpath
zshrs --prewarm-autoloads DIR ...    # just these
zd prewarm [DIR ...]                 # same, via the daemon
```

`zshrs-recorder` runs the pass at the end of every recording (skip it
with `--no-prewarm`), which is where it belongs: the parser walks
process-global lexer state, so this must never run beside a live ZLE.
Entries already current are skipped by mtime + length, so a re-run after
installing one plugin costs one `stat` per completer. Budget roughly
**6× the source size** — a 13k-completer directory compiles to 165 MB in
35 s (debug build).

Enabling the JIT is not the same as being compiled by it. `zshrs --tiers script.zsh` runs the script and then asks fusevm's own predicates — `is_block_eligible`, `block_jit_is_compiled`, `trace_is_compiled`, `find_jit_region` — which tier took each chunk, reporting the script body and every function body it dispatched. Chunks that reach neither tier list the op kinds responsible, so the output is a diagnosis (what to make native next) rather than a verdict.

The lexer and parser are direct ports from zsh's C source (`Src/lex.c`, `Src/parse.c`); only the bytecode compiler is original Rust. The 4-tier `ZshProgram → ZshList → ZshSublist → ZshPipe → ZshCommand` AST is preserved verbatim from zsh, ensuring per-construct behavior parity. The bytecode compiler targets the same `Op` enum that [strykelang](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/strykelang) uses. Both frontends share fused superinstructions, extension dispatch, and the Cranelift JIT path.

## [0x04] CONCURRENT PRIMITIVES

Full parallelism in the lean binary. No stryke dependency needed.

```zsh
# Async/await
id=$(async 'sleep 5; curl https://api.example.com')
result=$(await $id)

# Parallel map — ordered output
pmap 'gzip {}' *.log

# Parallel filter
pgrep 'grep -q TODO {}' **/*.rs

# Parallel for-each — unordered, fire as completed
peach 'convert {} {}.png' *.svg

# Barrier — run all, wait for all
barrier 'npm test' ::: 'cargo test' ::: 'pytest'
```

`pmap` / `pgrep` / `peach` run their body through the shared fusevm bytecode VM with the `{}` placeholder substituted as `${=__zshrs_p_arg__}` (matching zsh `SH_WORD_SPLIT` on literal substitution). The body is parsed and compiled to a fusevm `Chunk` ONCE before the input is iterated; the per-iteration loop sets the param via `setsparam`, acquires a VM from `fusevm::VMPool` (preserves Vec capacities across iterations), runs the cached chunk, and releases the VM back to the pool. `unsetparam` runs once at the end. No fork, no per-iteration parse/compile, no per-iteration VM allocation.

---

## [0x05] AOP INTERCEPT

First shell with aspect-oriented programming:

```zsh
# Before — log every git command
intercept before git { echo "[$(date)] git $INTERCEPT_ARGS" >> ~/git.log }

# After — timing
intercept after '_*' { echo "$INTERCEPT_NAME took ${INTERCEPT_MS}ms" }

# Around — memoize
intercept around expensive_func {
    local cache=/tmp/cache_${INTERCEPT_ARGS// /_}
    if [[ -f $cache ]]; then cat $cache
    else intercept_proceed | tee $cache; fi
}
```

The `{ … }` body is a zshrs syntax extension — zsh cannot parse a bare `}`
as an argument. The lexer captures the span between the braces as raw
source, so the body keeps its own redirections, pipelines and
here-documents, and nothing in it is expanded until the advice fires.
`zshrs --zsh` turns the extension off and rejects the form exactly as
`/bin/zsh` does; `intercept before git 'code'` works in every mode.

Bound while advice runs: `$INTERCEPT_NAME`, `$INTERCEPT_ARGS`,
`$INTERCEPT_CMD`, plus `$INTERCEPT_MS`, `$INTERCEPT_US` and
`$INTERCEPT_STATUS` for `after`.

---

## [0x06] WORKER THREAD POOL

Persistent pool of [2-18] threads. Configurable:

```toml
# ~/.zshrs/zshrs.toml  (single-directory rule; configurable via $ZSHRS_HOME)
[worker_pool]
size = 8

[completion]
bytecode_cache = true

[history]
async_writes = true

[glob]
parallel_threshold = 32
recursive_parallel = true

[zle]                      # fish-ported editor engines, all default off
autosuggest = true
syntax_highlight = true
history_search = true
autopair = true

[provenance]               # value-lineage engine; default true, and inert
enabled = true             # until `provenance -m NAME` arms it
track_all = false          # true = arm every parameter and every shell
                           # function with no `-m` at all
```

---

## [0x07] RKYV CACHE LAYOUT

Compiled bytecode and plugin/autoload payloads live in **rkyv** under `~/.zshrs/images/`:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **`index.rkyv`** | Top-level index: fq_name → shard id, generation, byte offset |
| **`images/{hash8}-*.rkyv`** | Mmap-ready shards (system, completions, plugins, scripts, `.zshrc`, …) |
| **`autoloads.rkyv`** | One compiled definition program per autoloaded function, keyed by name and stamped with the resolved fpath directory, a SHA-256 of the exact definition text, and the identity of the `zshrs` binary that compiled it |
| **`scripts.rkyv`** | One compiled chunk per script file, keyed by path + mtime |

**SQLite (read-only mirrors)** — same directory, different job: daemon-maintained copies you can query with SQL or `dbview`. They are **not** the bytecode cache and are **not** read when deciding cache hit/miss or when running compiled code.

| Store | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **`catalog.db`** | Joinable mirror of catalog metadata (human / tooling reads only) |
| **`history.db`** | Command history persistence (orthogonal to bytecode caching — not a cache layer for compiled chunks) |
| **Mirror / FTS views** | Optional SQL-side views of names and paths for `dbview` — read-only; see [`docs/DAEMON.md`](docs/DAEMON.md) |

Browse mirrors without SQL:

```zsh
dbview                        # list tables + row counts
dbview autoloads _git         # single function: source, body, bytecode status
dbview comps git              # search completions
dbview history docker         # search history
```

## [0x08] EXCLUSIVE BUILTINS

### Parallel Primitives (VM-executed, zero fork)

| Builtin | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `async` / `await` | Ship work to pool, collect result |
| `pmap` | Parallel map with ordered output — runs on VM, not fork |
| `pgrep` | Parallel filter — runs on VM, not fork |
| `peach` | Parallel for-each, unordered — runs on VM, not fork |
| `barrier` | Run all commands in parallel, wait for all |

### AOP / Debugging

| Builtin | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `intercept` | AOP before/after/around advice on any command |
| `intercept_proceed` | Call original from around advice |
| `doctor` | Full diagnostic: pool metrics, cache stats, bytecode coverage |
| `dbview` | Read-only browse of SQLite **mirrors** (not the rkyv cache) |
| `profile` | In-process command profiling with nanosecond accuracy |
| `provenance` | Value lineage — where a parameter's bytes came from and every bytecode op that touched them, each stamped with file, line and wall clock; shell functions carry the same chain ([`docs/PROVENANCE.md`](docs/PROVENANCE.md)) |
| `zbanner` | ZSHRS logo, a box with the version and builtin totals, and a live line: daemon socket status plus this shell's function, alias, parameter and job counts. `zshrs --banner` prints it from outside a shell, daemon status only |

`ZSHRS_STARTUP_TRACE=1` turns on the startup phase timer: every startup phase
prints `[startup <ms since process start>] <label>` to stderr, ending with
`FIRST PROMPT PAINTED`, so time-to-first-prompt can be attributed to a phase
rather than guessed at. Inert without the variable (one `OnceLock<bool>` read
per mark), so ordinary launches stay silent. Measure the shell itself with
`ZSHRS_STARTUP_TRACE=1 zshrs -f -i`; drop the `-f` to see what the rc files
cost on top of it.

`provenance` (ported from strykelang's `mark` / `provenance` / `unmark`) answers
"where did this value come from?" for a running shell — an origin plus the op
chain the bytecode actually executed. No other shell records this: `typeset -p`
answers what a value *is*, `set -x` / `PS4` answer what *ran*, and every
provenance or taint-tracking system that answers the lineage question does it
from outside the shell.

```console
$ cat build.zsh
provenance -m ARCHIVE
REPORT=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
ARCHIVE=${REPORT}.tar.gz
tar czf $ARCHIVE .
provenance ARCHIVE
$ zshrs build.zsh
ARCHIVE
  origin: cmdsubst "date +%Y-%m-%d" (build.zsh:2, 2026-08-18 11:22:03.908)
  ops:
     1. concat     "2026-08-18" ".tar.gz"                   build.zsh:3              11:22:03.908
     2. assign     ARCHIVE "2026-08-18.tar.gz"              build.zsh:3              11:22:03.908
     3. expand     $ARCHIVE "2026-08-18.tar.gz"             build.zsh:4              11:22:03.909
     4. exec       tar argv[2]                              build.zsh:4              11:22:03.909
```

Every row carries where and when it happened — file and line, the local
clock to the millisecond, and the enclosing shell function when the op
ran inside one (at its line in the file the function was *defined* in).

The chain covers the parameter's whole life, not one value: reassignment
appends an op and drops nothing, and a value arriving with its own lineage is
spliced in under an `origin` op.

Shell functions have chains of their own — definition site, every
redefinition, every call at the caller's line, and the `unfunction` that
ended it. `provenance -m NAME` arms whichever the name actually is, so a
function needs no extra flag; `-f` forces the function reading when a
parameter of the same name would otherwise win, and reads the chain
back:

```console
$ provenance -m greet          # arm it first — nothing is recorded until you do
$ greet; greet
$ provenance greet             # or `provenance -f greet`
greet()
  origin: function greet { MSG="hi $1" } (greet.zsh:2, 2026-08-18 11:48:01.139)
  ops:
     1. call       greet()                                  greet.zsh:3              11:48:01.139
     2. call       greet()                                  greet.zsh:4              11:48:01.140
```

The origin and every `redefine` carry the function's body (collapsed to one
line, truncated with `…`), so the chain shows what the body was and what it
was changed to. A `call` op carries the arguments the call was made with — `greet world`
records `greet(world)` — so repeated calls to one function stay
distinguishable; empty or whitespace-bearing arguments are single-quoted and
long lists are truncated with `…`.

Reading a name that was never armed is an error, not an empty chain —
`provenance -f greet` on its own answers `not tracked: greet()`.

### Language Model (`ai`, port of [`strykelang`](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/strykelang)'s `ai`)

`ai` calls a language model from inside the shell process. The answer streams
to stdout as it arrives, or lands in a parameter with `-v`/`-a` — the request
and the assignment happen in-process, where `reply=$(curl … | jq …)` costs two
forks, two execs, a pipe and a command substitution.

```zsh
ai explain the difference between '$@' and '$*'     # streamed to stdout
git diff --cached | ai -v msg -s 'Write a one-line commit message.'
ai -a steps list the steps to rotate a TLS cert     # one array element per line
ai -m claude-haiku-4-5 -t 256 -T 0 summarise: $text
ai -c                                               # cost + token report
```

With no prompt words, or a lone `-`, the prompt is read from stdin — so a
piped diff is the prompt only when no words follow `ai`; use `-s` for the
instruction.

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `-m MODEL` / `-P PROVIDER` / `-s SYSTEM` | model id, provider, system prompt |
| `-t N` / `-T FLOAT` / `-o SECS` | max output tokens, temperature, request timeout |
| `-v VAR` / `-a ARRAY` | assign to a scalar, or to an array one line per element (mutually exclusive) |
| `-b` | buffer instead of streaming |
| `-n` | bypass the response cache |
| `-k` | mark the system prompt `cache_control` (Anthropic prompt caching) |
| `-c` / `-H` / `-G` / `-K` | cost and token report, recent call history, current config, clear the cache |
| `-S key=value` | change a session default (the `[ai]` keys below) |
| `-M pattern=response` | install a mock: a prompt matching the regex answers `response` without a request |

Defaults come from `[ai]` in `~/.zshrs/zshrs.toml`:

```toml
[ai]
provider = "anthropic"            # anthropic | openai | local | ollama | gemini
model = "claude-opus-5"
api_key_env = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" # the NAME of the variable; the key itself stays in the environment
base_url = ""                     # local/ollama endpoint override
cache = true                      # in-process response cache
max_cost_run = 5.0                # USD ceiling for the shell process; 0 disables
max_tokens = 4096
timeout = 120
```

| Provider | Key | Endpoint |
|----------|-----|----------|
| `anthropic` (streams) | `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or whatever `api_key_env` names) | `api.anthropic.com` |
| `openai` | `$OPENAI_API_KEY` | `api.openai.com` |
| `local` / `compat` / `openai_compat` | `$ZSHRS_AI_LOCAL_KEY` | `base_url`, else `$ZSHRS_AI_BASE_URL`, else `localhost:1234` |
| `ollama` | — | `base_url`, else `$OLLAMA_HOST`, else `localhost:11434` |
| `gemini` / `google` | `$GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `$GEMINI_API_KEY` | `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` |

Every call is billed against `max_cost_run`, from a price table built into the
binary; once the process has spent that much, `ai` refuses rather than
calling. The buffered Anthropic path retries 429, 500, 502, 503 and 504 up to four
attempts with exponential backoff. `ZSHRS_AI_MODE=mock-only` makes a prompt
that no `-M` mock matches an error instead of a live call — what a test suite
wants. Exit status: 0 on success, 1 when the call failed (no key, HTTP or
transport error, cost ceiling), 2 for bad flags; the reason goes to stderr as
`zshrs: ai: <reason>`.

Nothing is recorded until `provenance -m` arms it — or until something
turns on track-everything mode, which arms every parameter write and
every function with no `-m` at all: `provenance -a` at runtime,
`[provenance] track_all = true` in `~/.zshrs/zshrs.toml` from startup, or
`ZSHRS_PROVENANCE_ALL=1` in the environment. Self-rewriting parameters
(`LINENO`, `RANDOM`, `status`, the positionals, …) stay out of it, and
4096 auto-armed names is the ceiling. `[provenance] enabled = false` (or
`ZSHRS_PROVENANCE=0`) refuses arming altogether.

## [0x09] SHELL LANGUAGE FEATURES

Every shell construct compiles to fusevm bytecode — no tree-walker dispatch lives in zshrs. The [full reference](https://menketechnologies.github.io/zshrs/reference.html) documents each entry with a runnable example.

### Control flow

```zsh
# Standard POSIX/zsh control structures — all compile to fusevm bytecode
if [[ -d $dir ]]; then …; elif [[ -f $dir ]]; then …; else …; fi
while (( i < 10 )); do …; done
until ping -c1 host >/dev/null; do sleep 1; done
for f in *.rs; do echo "$f"; done
for ((i=0; i<10; i++)); do …; done
case $cmd in start) … ;; stop) … ;; *) … ;; esac
select choice in build test deploy; do … done   # interactive numbered menu
coproc { while read l; do echo "ECHO: $l"; done } # bidirectional pipe
```

### Indexed arrays

```zsh
arr=(alpha beta gamma)            # literal
arr+=(delta epsilon)              # append
echo ${arr[1]}                    # alpha (1-based)
echo ${arr[-1]}                   # epsilon (negative from end)
echo ${arr[@]}                    # splice — N argv slots
echo ${#arr[@]}                   # length
for x in ${arr[@]}; do …; done    # iterate (flattens via BUILTIN_ARRAY_FLATTEN)
```

### Associative arrays

```zsh
typeset -A m                      # declare
m[name]=Alice; m[role]=eng        # set
echo "${m[name]}"                 # lookup
for k in "${(k)m}"; do echo $k; done   # keys
for v in "${(v)m}"; do echo $v; done   # values
```

### Parameter expansion flags (zsh-style)

```zsh
echo ${(L)var}                    # lowercase
echo ${(U)var}                    # uppercase
echo ${(j: :)arr}                 # join with space
echo ${(s:,:)scalar}              # split on comma → array
echo ${(f)$(cmd)}                 # split on newlines
echo ${(o)arr}                    # sort ascending
echo ${(O)arr}                    # sort descending
echo ${(P)ref}                    # indirect lookup
echo ${(jL)arr}                   # stack: join then lowercase
echo ${(s:,:U)scalar}             # stack: split then uppercase
```

### Parameter expansion forms

```zsh
${var:-default}                   # default if unset/empty
${var:=default}                   # assign default
${var:?msg}                       # error if unset
${var:+alt}                       # alternate if set
${#var}                           # length
${var:offset:length}              # substring
${var#pat} / ${var##pat}          # strip shortest/longest prefix
${var%pat} / ${var%%pat}          # strip shortest/longest suffix
${var/pat/repl} / ${var//pat/repl} # replace first/all
${var:u} / ${var:l}               # upper/lower case (zsh postfix)
```

### Background, async, coprocesses

```zsh
sleep 30 &                        # fork + setsid; parent gets Status(0)
jobs; fg %1; wait $!              # job control
async 'expensive-task' | xargs await   # worker-pool, no fork
coproc { body }                   # bidirectional pipe; $COPROC=[rd_fd, wr_fd]
echo hi >/dev/fd/${COPROC[2]}     # write to coproc stdin
read line </dev/fd/${COPROC[1]}   # read from coproc stdout
```

### Eval, dynamic dispatch, AOP

```zsh
eval 'echo $x'                    # single-quoted args defer expansion correctly
cmd=ls; $cmd -la                  # dynamic command name routes through host intercepts
intercept before git { …; }       # AOP advice fires for both literal and dynamic invocations
```

## [0x0A] COMPATIBILITY

- Full zsh script compatibility — runs existing `.zshrc`
- Full bash compatibility via emulation
- **Native fish-ported line-editor engines** (ON by default; every engine is refused when `RCS` is unset, so bare `zshrs -f` stays byte-identical to `zsh -f` for parity, and per-feature `false` in `~/.zshrs/zshrs.toml` `[zle]` opts out): syntax highlighting (lexer-driven command/keyword/quote/redirection/path coloring with command-validity and file-existence checks; the engine is the fish port, the palette and word-level classification are `fast-syntax-highlighting`'s — command-type ladder, brackets-by-nesting-level pass, glob/variable/path/option/math/here-string/case styles, secondary theme inside `$(…)`, and the `autoload` / `source` / `printf` chromas — so the native pass renders the same as the plugin it replaces), history autosuggestions (ghost text, accept with →/End, word-wise accept with forward-word), prefix/substring up-arrow history search, and bracket/quote auto-pairing (zsh-autopair port) — ports of the fish-shell Rust engines that zsh-syntax-highlighting, zsh-autosuggestions, and zsh-history-substring-search recreate in script. Existing plugin config applies (`ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES`, `ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_*`, `HISTORY_SUBSTRING_SEARCH_*`, `AUTOPAIR_*`); the native engines stay authoritative even with the script plugins loaded (their config honored, their widgets subsumed); `ZSHRS_NATIVE_ZLE_FX=0` force-disables. Per-keystroke passes are wall-clock budgeted (`ZSHRS_ZLE_{HIGHLIGHT,AUTOSUGGEST}_BUDGET_MS`, default 8) so huge directories or PATHs can never lag typing
- Fish-style abbreviations
- **243 builtins** (152 zsh ports + 91 extensions, the latter including 23 coreutils and the parallel primitives) — see the [Reference](https://menketechnologies.github.io/zshrs/reference.html) for the full catalog
- **Self-contained `fpath`** — zsh's whole function tree (`Completion/**` + `Functions/**`, flattened the way `make install` flattens it) is packed into the binary at build time and written to `~/.zshrs/functions` on first run, alongside zshrs's own per-builtin completions. That directory is the entire default `fpath`, and it sits LAST — it supplies only what nothing else on `fpath` does, so a curated completion of the same name always wins. Two invariants hold on every `fpath` assignment, not just at startup: the bundled directory is always present (a config doing `fpath=( mydir )` gets it re-appended), and a host zsh installation's own `<prefix>/share/zsh/<version>/functions` is always absent. The two are never mixed — a foreign zsh's `compinit`/`_git` beside zshrs's own means the lookup winner decides behaviour, and that changes when the package manager upgrades zsh. Host zsh installation directories are dropped — from the compiled-in default and from an inherited `FPATH` alike — so `<prefix>/share/zsh/<version>/functions` and `share/zsh/site-functions` never shadow the bundle. zshrs's `compinit`, `_git` and `_describe` are the ones it shipped with, and a Homebrew zsh upgrade cannot change how the shell completes. User and plugin directories are untouched. The tree is re-written when the bundle's content hash changes, not merely when the version does
- **`async_precmd` hook** — precmd-style functions registered here run on a pool worker thread instead of blocking the prompt, so a slow vcs status or network check never delays the prompt paint. The batch is serialized against the shell thread's own shell code — parameter scopes are one counter and one table, shared — so a widget, hook or command waits for a batch that is already running, and withdraws one the pool has not started yet (its hooks run at the next prompt). Plain typing never waits: builtin widgets open no scope. Registered the normal way, `add-zsh-hook async_precmd my_fn`: zshrs ships an `add-zsh-hook` whose hook list knows the name, since upstream's fixed list rejects it
- **Bundled `man` / `info`** — zsh's manual pages (`zsh`, `zshall`, `zshbuiltins`, `zshexpn`, `zshmisc`, `zshoptions`, `zshparam`, `zshzle`, `zshcompsys` …) and the Texinfo manual ship in the binary the same way, materialising to `~/.zshrs/man/man1` and `~/.zshrs/info`. Those directories are prepended to `MANPATH` and `INFOPATH` with an empty trailing entry, so the system's own search path is still spliced in and every other page on the machine keeps resolving. `man zshall` and `info zsh` work on a host with no zsh installed. `run-help`'s help database and the `newuser` script ship the same way, to `~/.zshrs/help` and `~/.zshrs/scripts`, with `HELPDIR` pointed at the former unless the user set one — zsh's own `run-help` hardcodes the help path of whichever zsh built it, which is dead on any other machine. `HELPDIR` is a shell parameter only, never exported: `run-help` is a shell function that reads it out of the parameter table, so there is nothing to put in a child's environment
- ZWC precompiled function support
- Glob qualifiers, parameter expansion flags, completion system
- zstyle, ZLE widgets, hooks, modules
- Per-shell emulation drop-ins: `--zsh`, `--bash`, `--ksh`, `--mksh`, `--pdksh`, `--sh`/`--posix`, `--dash`, and `--ash`. `--mksh` (MirBSD ksh) and `--pdksh` (Public Domain ksh) share the `--ksh` base; `--ash` (Almquist shell) is an alias of `--dash`. `--dash` is a strict Debian Almquist Shell mode — it applies the `sh` option presets and additionally rejects the zsh-only syntax dash has never had (`$'...'` ANSI-C quoting, `<<<` here-strings, `+=` compound assignment, `name=(...)` arrays, the `[[ ]]` reserved word, arith `**`/`,`, and `printf %q`) while using XSI `echo` — verified byte-for-byte against `/bin/dash`
- Startup files follow the emulated shell, not zsh, and every drop-in works as a real login shell (`argv[0]`-dash install, per-shell profile/rc/logout chain, `$ENV` / `$BASH_ENV`, bash's `--norc` / `--noprofile` / `--rcfile`, and bash's `$PS1` backslash escapes with `${var@P}`). Each row is verified against the reference binary — bash 5.3.15, ksh93, mksh, dash, tcsh, zsh 5.9 — not against its manual. See the login-shell coverage matrix below.
- Drop-in fidelity beyond zsh's own `emulate`: the bare POSIX-family modes match the REAL shell, not zsh's approximation of it. `--sh`/`--dash`/`--ash` use XSI `echo` (backslash escapes interpreted without `-e`, as both `/bin/sh` flavours and `dash` do) where zsh's `emulate sh` sets `BSD_ECHO`, and `--bash` accepts bash's own `set -o` names — including the six zsh has no option for (`posix`, `errtrace`, `functrace`, `history`, `keyword`, `nolog`) — reporting them through `set -o`, `set +o` and `$SHELLOPTS`. Adding `--zsh` (`--sh --zsh`, `--ksh --zsh`) selects zsh-STYLE emulation instead: the option deltas a real zsh installs for `emulate sh` / `emulate ksh`, referenced against zsh itself.

#### Login-shell coverage matrix

Every drop-in is usable as a real login shell — installed by symlinking the
binary under the target shell's name and letting `login(1)` / `sshd` exec it
with a leading dash on `argv[0]`:

```sh
ln -s /path/to/zshrs ~/bin/bash    # the NAME selects the personality
# add the path to /etc/shells, then
chsh -s ~/bin/bash
```

The symlink's NAME is what selects the personality — the same `argv[0]`
inference C zsh does at `Src/init.c:1869+` — so install one link per shell you
want to stand in for. Each row names the binary its behaviour was measured
against:

| drop-in | symlink name | login shell starts it as | verified against |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--bash` | `bash` | `-bash` | GNU bash 5.3.15 |
| `--ksh` | `ksh` | `-ksh` | ksh93 (AT&T; macOS `/bin/ksh`) |
| `--mksh` | `mksh` | `-mksh` | mksh (MirBSD Korn shell) |
| `--pdksh` | `pdksh` | `-pdksh` | not installed here — rules taken from OpenBSD `ksh(1)` |
| `--sh` / `--posix` | `sh` | `-sh` | `/bin/sh` (bash 3.2 in sh mode on macOS, dash on Debian) |
| `--dash` / `--ash` | `dash` / `ash` | `-dash` / `-ash` | dash |
| `--csh` | `csh` | `-csh` | tcsh (macOS `/bin/csh`) |
| `--zsh` | `zsh` | `-zsh` | zsh 5.9 |

The whole table below is re-checked against those binaries by the startup-file
parity + fuzz harness on every run. `$ENV` is expanded (parameter, command,
arithmetic and tilde substitution) before use in every shell that reads it.

| drop-in | login shell reads | interactive non-login reads | non-interactive reads | on login exit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--bash` | `/etc/profile`, then the first readable of `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`, `~/.profile` | `/etc/bash.bashrc` (where shipped), `~/.bashrc` | `$BASH_ENV` | `~/.bash_logout` |
| `--ksh` | `/etc/profile`, `~/.profile`, then the interactive file | `/etc/ksh.kshrc` (where shipped), `$ENV` — default `~/.kshrc` | — | — |
| `--mksh` | `/etc/profile`, `~/.profile`, then the interactive file | `$ENV`, or `~/.mkshrc` when `$ENV` is unset | — | — |
| `--pdksh` | `/etc/profile`, `~/.profile`, then the interactive file | `$ENV` — no default | — | — |
| `--sh` / `--posix` | `/etc/profile`, `~/.profile`, then the interactive file | `$ENV` — no default | — | — |
| `--dash` / `--ash` | `/etc/profile`, `~/.profile`, then the interactive file | `$ENV` — no default | — | — |
| `--csh` | the non-login files, then `/etc/csh.login`, `~/.login` | `/etc/csh.cshrc`, then `~/.tcshrc` or `~/.cshrc` | same as interactive — csh reads its rc file either way | `~/.logout`, `/etc/csh.logout` |
| `--zsh` | `/etc/zprofile`, `~/.zprofile`, then the interactive files | `/etc/zshrc`, `~/.zshrc` | `/etc/zshenv`, `~/.zshenv` (read on every invocation) | `~/.zlogout`, `/etc/zlogout` |

Rules that differ per shell, each measured rather than assumed:

| behaviour | bash | ksh / mksh / pdksh / sh / dash | csh | zsh |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| interactive **login** shell also reads the interactive rc file | no — profile only | yes | yes | yes |
| login by `argv[0]` dash alone, non-interactive, reads the profile | **no** — needs `-i` or an explicit `--login` | yes | yes | yes |
| `-f` means | `noglob` | `noglob` | no-rcs | no-rcs |
| suppress every startup file | `--norc --noprofile`, or `--no-rcs` | `--no-rcs` | `--no-rcs` | `-f` / `--no-rcs` |
| `$PS1` escapes | backslash (`\u`, `\h`, `\w`, `\$`, …), plus `${var@P}` | literal text | literal text | `%` escapes |
| bracketed paste (`\e[?2004h`) | yes | no | no | yes |
| OSC 133 shell-integration marker | no | no | no | yes |
| zsh partial-line `%` marker (`PROMPT_SP`) | no | no | no | yes |
| zshrs's own line-editor engines (autosuggestion ghost text, input syntax highlighting, history search, autopair) | off | off | off | on |

Startup state beyond the files — also per-shell, also measured:

The Korn column targets the **maintained** ksh93u+m 1.0.10 line, not AT&T
ksh93u+ 2012 (which macOS still ships as `/bin/ksh`). The two differ in both
rows below: the 2012 line shipped 19 default aliases and printed a labelled
`user\t0m0.00s` for `times`, and 93u+m ships neither. Following the
maintained fork also fails safer — omitting an alias leaves a command
resolving to its builtin, whereas inventing one shadows a real command.

| behaviour | bash | ksh93 | mksh / pdksh | dash / ash / sh | zsh |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| default aliases | none | none | 11 (`autoload`, `functions`, `r`, …) | none | 2 (`run-help`, `which-command`) |
| `alias` listing form | `alias NAME='value'` | `NAME=value` | `NAME=value` | `NAME=value` | `NAME=value` |
| `export -p` / `readonly -p` | `declare -x NAME="v"` / `declare -r` | `export NAME=v` | `export NAME=v` | `export NAME='v'` | zsh's own |
| `times` fraction | milliseconds | milliseconds, seconds zero-padded | centiseconds, seconds zero-padded | microseconds | centiseconds |
| `times` seconds field | `% 60` | `% 60` | `% 60` | `% 60` | `% clock-tick` (zsh's own arithmetic) |
| `kill -l` | `%2d) SIG%s`, five per row | one bare name per line (`IOT` for 6) | two columns with the `strsignal` text | signal `0`, then one name per line | one space-separated line |
| `hash` | `hits`/`command` table | `name=path` | `name=path` (reached via its own `hash` alias → `alias -t`) | the bare path | `name=path` |
| `set -o` | 27 names, `name<TAB>state` | 38 names under "Current option settings", POSITIVE sense (`clobber on`) | 35 names in four column-major columns | 17 names under "Current option settings" | zsh's ~180 |
| `set +o` | `set -o NAME` per line | one line: `set --default` + the non-default ON options | one line: `set -o .reset -o NAME …` | `set -o NAME` per line | zsh's form |
| `trap -l` | the `kill -l` table | rejected, exit 2 | rejected, exit 1 | rejected, exit 2 | silent no-op, exit 0 |
| error in a special builtin | continues (exit 2 from the builtin) | aborts the script | aborts | aborts | continues |

A privileged shell (effective uid ≠ real uid) reads no user file at all; the
Korn and Bourne drop-ins take `/etc/suid_profile` in place of the profile pair.

The zshrs-original line-editor engines are off in every parity mode, `--zsh`
included, and on only when zshrs is being itself. None of the shells zshrs
stands in for renders autosuggestion ghost text or colours the command line
as you type, so a drop-in that did could not look like its reference.
`ZSHRS_NATIVE_ZLE_FX` overrides the default in both directions: `=1` brings
the engines back inside a drop-in, `=0` turns them off natively. The OSC 133
shell-integration markers are gated the same way.

POSIX requires that "if there is an error in a special built-in utility …
the shell shall abort", and ksh93u+m, mksh and dash all do — `readonly -X`,
`export -X` or `shift 99` end the script. bash only does so under `set -o
posix`, and zsh never does, so the drop-ins follow their own shell. The
boundary is an ERROR, not a non-zero status: `eval false`, `trap "" BOGUS`
and `unset novar` return normally in every one of them, and the harness pins
those negatives so the rule cannot widen into "any failing special builtin
kills the script".

Three known divergences are deliberate rather than pending. `ulimit -a` still
uses zsh's layout in every mode: the four shells disagree on the resource
SET as well as the labels (bash 11 rows, ksh93 24, mksh 10, dash 10), and the
set is platform-dependent, so a faithful table has to be built per platform
rather than captured from one machine. And `--ksh`'s `echo` interprets
backslash escapes: ksh93's `echo` deliberately follows the host's
`/bin/echo`, so it interprets on Linux/SysV and does not on macOS — the
drop-in follows the XSI convention rather than encoding one platform's.
Finally `set -X` is accepted in every mode: zsh takes `-X` as a valid option
letter and so does zshrs, where ksh93 and dash reject it — matching that
needs a per-shell table of valid `set` letters, which is not built.

### Compatibility measurement

Three independent measurements, all re-runnable. Numbers below were taken on
macOS aarch64 against `zsh 5.9.2` (`/opt/homebrew/bin/zsh`) as the oracle.

**Differential parity suite** — [`tests/parity/`](tests/parity) is the largest
measurement here: 47,035 hand-written assertions run against real `zsh`,
comparing stdout, exit status and (for diagnostics) stderr.

```

Latest full run: **46,985 passed, 6 failed, 18 ignored**. Reading those two
small numbers honestly:

- Of the 6 failures, 3 were environmental — `binary_parity` spawns
  `target/debug/zshrs-daemon`, which a concurrent `cargo clean` had removed;
  rebuilding it (`cargo build -p zshrs-daemon`) restores 4/4. One more passes
  in isolation and only fails under heavy parallel load. That leaves **2 real**:
  a coproc job-table listing and dash-mode `getopts` state.
- The 18 ignored are documented gaps, each `#[ignore]`d with a citation and an
  entry in [`docs/BUGS.md`](docs/BUGS.md). Five are reference-version skew
  rather than defects: the port follows the vendored C tree in
  `~/forkedRepos/zsh` (`5.9.0.3-test`), which carries changes absent from the
  released 5.9.x line — `time` on builtins, `:S` history-style substitution,
  dotted parameter namespaces, `typeset -n`. Verified against BOTH 5.9 and
  5.9.2: each rejects all four, so zshrs is ahead of the oracle, not wrong.
  The rest are open bugs.
- One case (`probe_b_row_149`) flips run to run with machine load; it is a
  genuine residual job-control race, not a flaky test.

**Differential fuzz** — [`bins/parity-fuzz.rs`](bins/parity-fuzz.rs) generates
seed-replayable snippets per grammar mode, runs them through both shells, and
flags any stdout/exit divergence. Every case is re-confirmed 3x (`--verify 3`)
so a single load-induced flake cannot register as a divergence.

```
parity-fuzz --mode <mode> --count 300 --verify 3 --timeout-ms 20000
```

| | zsh oracle | emulation targets |
|---|---|---|
| Cases | 22,200 (74 modes) | 2,100 (7 shells) |
| Divergences | **27 (0.12%)** | 709 (33.8%) |
| Modes/targets at zero | **71 of 74** | -- |

All residual zsh-mode divergence is in three modes, and each has a single
identified root cause:

| Mode | Count | Root cause |
|---|---|---|
| `unicode` | 18 | `unsetopt multibyte` is not honoured. zsh drops to BYTE semantics (so `[[:alpha:]]` matches one byte of a multibyte character); zshrs stays in character mode. All 18 cases set the option. |
| `quote` | 8 | zsh's token bytes `0x84`-`0xA1` (`Src/lex.c:38` `ztokens`) are stored as Rust `char`s, so a real codepoint in U+0084-U+00A1 is indistinguishable from a token. Verified boundary: U+009F/A0/A1 mangle under `(V)`/`(q)`/`(qqqq)`, U+00A2 and above are clean. C avoids this by Meta-escaping bytes. |
| `zmv` | 1 | `zmv -W` no-match error reports the unconverted pattern and the shell's own name (`zsh:1: no matches found: *.*`) instead of zsh's converted pattern and function context (`zmv:239: no matches found: (*).(*)`). |

Two further notes on reading this table:

- `prompt` shows 0 divergences but a reproducible ~10-12% timeout rate at a
  20 s limit; the harness reports timeouts separately and does not attribute
  a side.
- Run the sweep DETACHED (`nohup`, CI, a supervisor) and the shell inherits
  `SIGQUIT` as `SIG_IGN`. zsh records that as an ignored trap and lists
  `trap -- '' QUIT` (`c:Src/init.c:1444-1445`), and an inherited `SIGHUP`
  ignore clears the `HUP` option (`c:1451-1452`). zshrs reached neither,
  because its `-c` and script-file dispatch bypass `init_signals`; the
  `trap` mode reported ~114/300 in that context and 0 in a foreground
  shell. Fixed by porting just those two records onto the bypass paths
  (`src/extensions/startup_signals.rs`) — NOT by calling `init_signals`
  there, which also installs C's SIGCHLD handler and regresses pipeline
  and job reaping badly (measured: `pipeline` 0 -> 139). Converging those
  dispatch paths onto `zsh_main` is still the structurally correct fix.
  The recording is ZSH-only and gated off in the drop-in modes: with both
  signals inherited-ignored, `trap` prints the QUIT line in zsh, both
  signals SIG-prefixed in bash, and nothing at all in dash/ksh/sh.

Per emulation target, out of 300 each: `ksh` 163, `mksh` 130, `pdksh` 130,
`bash` 112, `sh` 80, `dash` 47, `ash` 47. The emulation modes are held to a
weaker contract than zsh mode -- exit-status *sign* rather than exact code --
because the reference shells disagree with each other on exact codes.

**Upstream ztst corpus** -- the `.ztst` files shipped with zsh, run by
[`tests/ztst_runner.rs`](tests/ztst_runner.rs):

```
cargo test --test ztst_runner -- --nocapture   # per-file chunk tallies
```

**1,798 of 2,604 chunks pass (69.0%)**; 776 fail, 30 skip. 23 of the 70 files
are 100% green.

Read the cargo line with care: the 70 file-level tests report `ok`
unconditionally. `run_ztst` prints `NOTE: N failures … (baseline mode — not
failing CI)` and never asserts, so "70 passed, 0 failed" measures nothing. The
chunk tally above — summed from the per-file lines under `--nocapture` — is the
real figure.

The failures are far more structural than 776 independent bugs. Six files score
zero, and five of them for a single reason:

| Source | Failed | Passed | Cause |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Y03arguments.ztst` | 97 | 0 | prep TIMEOUT |
| `X05zleincarg.ztst` | 95 | 0 | prep TIMEOUT |
| `X02zlevi.ztst` | 95 | 0 | prep TIMEOUT |
| `Y02compmatch.ztst` | 58 | 0 | prep TIMEOUT |
| `Y01completion.ztst` | 33 | 0 | prep TIMEOUT |
| `V01zmodload.ztst` | 40 | 0 | prep exits 1 |
| `D04parameter.ztst` | 48 | 197 | genuine per-chunk gaps |
| `B02typeset.ztst` | 28 | 60 | genuine per-chunk gaps |
| `V10private.ztst` | 28 | 14 | genuine per-chunk gaps |
| `K01nameref.ztst` | 19 | 112 | genuine per-chunk gaps |

**378 chunks — 49% of every failure — are blocked by the 10 s prep budget, not
by shell behaviour.** Those files' `%prep` runs `comptestinit`, which spawns the
shell under test inside `zsh/zpty` and runs `compinit` in it; against a debug
build that needs 60-90 s. At `ZTST_TIMEOUT_MS=90000` the `Y03arguments` prep
completes. Past it, the first pty completion round-trip then hangs, which wedges
the file's shell and marks every later chunk "not run" — so this whole block is
one bug plus one budget, not 378 defects. `zsh/zpty` itself is sound: `-r -m`,
`-w` and `-t` all behave, and a spawn → `compinit` → `zle -C` sequence completes
through a pty.

The `D04`/`B02`/`V10`/`K01` shape is the opposite and the honest measure of
remaining debt: broadly working, with a real tail.

A second, independent accounting agrees. `tests/gen/ztst_failures.rs` pins 1,292
individual chunks as `#[ignore]`d known gaps; running them
(`cargo test --test ztst_runner -- --ignored`) gives **546 passed, 746 failed**.
The 746 lines up with the 776 counted from the file-level tally, from a
completely different code path, so the 69% figure is not an artifact of how one
of them counts.

It also means **546 of the 1,292 pins (42%) are stale** — they were pinned
against gaps that have since been fixed and nobody un-pinned them. Read the pin
list as an upper bound on debt, not a measurement of it; the chunk tally is the
measurement.

The gap between the fuzz figure and the ztst figure is intentional and worth
reading carefully: the fuzzer samples the grammar it knows how to generate,
while ztst samples what zsh's own authors thought worth testing. The ztst
number is the one that predicts daily-driver trust.

## [0x0B] ARCHITECTURE

The codebase is **structurally divided into ported code vs extensions**, with the boundary mechanically enforced by `tests/port_purity.rs`. Bots, contributors, and humans all read [`docs/PORT.md`](docs/PORT.md) before writing a single line.

### Directory rule (PORT.md)

| Directory | Rule | Enforcement |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `src/ported/` | **Strict 1:1 port.** Every `.rs` mirrors a real upstream zsh `Src/<x>.c`; every top-level `fn` carries `/// Port of <cname>() from Src/<file>.c:NNNN`; no invented helpers; **directory and file set FROZEN** (106 files, no new files allowed). | `tests/port_purity.rs` |
| `src/compsys/ported/` | **1:1 mirror of zsh's `Completion/` tree.** Engine functions (`Base/{Completer,Core,Utility,Widget}`, `Zsh/Context`, plus engine-only entries in `Unix/Type`, `Zsh/Type`, `Zsh/Command`, `Unix/Command`, and top-level `compinit`/`compdump`) are ported to Rust as `<name>.rs` and carry a `Port of _<NAME>` header citing the upstream shell source. End-user shell completers (`*/Command`, `Zsh/Function`, end-user type files) are **copied as-is alongside** the Rust ports — same dir layout, same filename, no `.rs` extension — and dispatched via the `_call_function` bridge. Current coverage: **991 upstream files mirrored, 247 engine .rs ports**. Regenerate the coverage report with `scripts/gen_compsys_port_report.py`. | per-fn tests; doc-comment shell-source citations; `gen_compsys_port_report.py` |
| `src/extensions/` | **Non-port only.** Features zsh C demonstrably does *not* have. Must not duplicate or shadow any port. | `port_purity` exempts the 1:1 file rule for this directory only |
| `src/recorder/` | **Feature-gated.** Every symbol `#[cfg(feature = "recorder")]`; deleted by rustc when off. | `Cargo.toml` `required-features = ["recorder"]` on the `zshrs-recorder` bin |

## [0x0C] EDITOR INTEGRATION

zshrs ships an **LSP server** and **DAP debug adapter** built into the
binary, plus a **JetBrains IDE plugin** that drives both.

**First Bourne-lineage shell with a language server in its own binary.**
The idea is not new outside that lineage — Nushell has `nu --lsp` and
Elvish has `elvish -lsp` (since 0.18.0), and Endo (v0.1.0, F#-inspired,
not POSIX) ships LSP plus DAP. Inside it, no shell does: bash, zsh, ksh,
dash and fish ship neither `--lsp` nor `--dap`. `bash-language-server`
and `fish-lsp` are separate Node/TypeScript packages that reimplement a
parser the shell already has, zsh has no mainstream server at all, and
`vscode-bash-debug` is a VS Code extension shelling out to the external
`bashdb` script. Because the server *is* the shell, zshrs's LSP answers
from the same lexer, parser, option table and compsys completers the
interactive shell uses — including live `_git` / `_docker` / `_ssh`
completion inside the editor (see below), which no shell language server
of any lineage does.

### CLI flags

```sh
zshrs --lsp                  # LSP server over stdio
zshrs --dap HOST:PORT        # DAP debugger; TCP connect-back to IDE listener
zshrs --dap                  # DAP debugger over stdio (executable-spawned clients)
zshrs --dump-reflection      # JSON dump of builtins / keywords / options
zshrs --dump-plugins         # JSON dump of every sourced plugin grouped
                             # by manager (zinit / oh-my-zsh / prezto /
                             # antidote / antigen / zplug / loose);
                             # feeds the IDE's External Libraries view
zshrs --docs <name>          # render the LSP hover card for <name>
zshrs --fmt [-w] [-t] [-i N] [FILE…]
                             # format zsh source: block-structure
                             # reindent + idiomatic spacing (dedupe
                             # runs; a;b → a; b, a&&b → a && b,
                             # a|b → a | b, cmd& → cmd &, x;; → x ;;,
                             # f () → f(), bare then/do join onto
                             # the opener as '; then'/'; do' per the
                             # zsh + OMZ style guides), heredoc-safe,
                             # idempotent. Indent defaults to 4
                             # spaces per level; editor tabSize and
                             # CLI -i N override explicitly.
                             # stdin→stdout with no files; -w rewrites
                             # in place; -i sets indent width (default
                             # 4); -t indents with tabs
```

All six flags dispatch from `bins/zshrs.rs` into `src/extensions/lsp.rs`,
`src/extensions/dap.rs`, and `src/extensions/plugin_cache.rs`. The LSP and
DAP modules are dependency-free additions
(no `lsp-server` / `lsp-types` / `dap-types` crates) — Content-Length
framing + JSON-RPC are hand-rolled on top of `serde_json` to keep the
default build lean.

### LSP capabilities (`zshrs --lsp`)

| Capability                          | Trigger                                  |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `completion`                        | builtins, keywords, options, special vars, in-file functions **plus live compsys matches** — the same `_git` / `_docker` / `_ssh` completers a Tab press drives, so `git ch` completes `checkout` and `git checkout ` lists branches (see `docs/IN_EDITOR_COMPSYS_COMPLETION.md`). Writing a completer is covered too: inside an `_arguments` spec, the action field offers completer names and the inline action forms (`(list)`, `((val\:desc))`, `->state`) |
| `hover`                             | markdown cards for builtins / keywords / options / special vars |
| `definition` / `references`         | function names declared in the open document |
| `documentHighlight`                 | same scan as references                  |
| `documentSymbol`                    | `function foo`, `foo()`, `alias`, `local`/`typeset`/`export` |
| `foldingRange`                      | `{ … }` / `do … done` / `case … esac` blocks + ≥3 `#` comment runs |
| `rename` (with `prepareRename`)     | word-boundary aware replace across document |
| `semanticTokens/full`               | comment / string / number / keyword / variable / function classes |
| `formatting`                        | full syntax-aware reindent + idiomatic spacing (`src/extensions/fmt.rs`, same engine as `--fmt`): if/fi, do/done, case arms, `{ }`, `( )`, `[[ ]]`, continuations; whitespace dedupe and canonical `;` `&&` `\|\|` `\|` `&` `;;` spacing with quote/`${…}`/fd-redirect/glob-pattern guards; heredoc bodies verbatim |
| `publishDiagnostics`                | brace + block matching, unclosed strings, lights up on `didOpen` / `didChange` / `didSave` |

Trigger characters for completion: `$`, `{`, `-`, `:`. Optional
`ZSHRS_LSP_LOG=<path>` env var dumps every request/response for debugging.

Compsys completion reads the recorded environment from the canonical
rkyv shard (`~/.zshrs/images/*-recorder.rkyv`) — `compdef` map, `fpath`,
autoload stubs, `zstyle` — so it needs `zshrs-recorder` to have run at
least once; without a shard the LSP still completes everything else in
the table above. Completers that shell out (`git for-each-ref` behind
`git checkout <tab>`) run with their subprocess killed at the request
deadline, and never inherit the editor's stdin/stdout.

### DAP capabilities (`zshrs --dap [HOST:PORT]`)

Two transports, same DAP server: `--dap HOST:PORT` connects back to the IDE's
TCP listener (JetBrains; keeps stdout free for the script), while bare `--dap`
serves DAP over stdio for clients that spawn the adapter as an executable
(e.g. VS Code's `DebugAdapterExecutable`).

| Request                               | Behaviour (v1)                          |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `initialize` / `configurationDone`    | full capability advertisement, emits `initialized` event |
| `setBreakpoints`                      | stored per-file, ack with `verified: true` |
| `launch`                              | spawn `zshrs <program> <args>` as a child process |
| `threads` / `stackTrace` / `scopes`   | single-thread model, one synthetic frame |
| `variables`                           | environment snapshot (scope ref 1)      |
| `evaluate`                            | runs `zshrs -c <expr>` against current `cwd`, returns stdout |
| `continue` / `next` / `stepIn` / `stepOut` | acked (no per-statement pause in v1) |
| `pause`                               | emits `stopped { reason: "pause" }`     |
| `disconnect` / `terminate`            | kills the child process                 |
| program stdout / stderr               | streamed as DAP `output` events         |
| child exit                            | fires `terminated` event                |

Deeper integration (per-statement pause, breakpoint honouring against the
live interpreter, scope walk-back into the `Param` table) is scaffolded
via `dap::install_hooks(DapHooks { … })` and lands incrementally.

### JetBrains plugin (`editors/intellij/`)

```sh
cd editors/intellij
JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17) ./gradlew buildPlugin
# → build/distributions/zshrs-intellij-<version>.zip
```

Install via *Settings → Plugins → ⚙ → Install Plugin from Disk…*.

Plugin features:

- **File types**: `.zsh` + every dot-rc (`.zshrc`, `.zshenv`, `.zlogin`,
  `.zlogout`, `.zprofile`, `.zpreztorc`).
- **Hand-rolled lexer** with 45 independently-themeable color slots
  (*Settings → Editor → Color Scheme → zshrs*).
- **LSP client** auto-starts `zshrs --lsp` on first file open. Hover,
  completion, goto-definition, references, rename, document symbols,
  semantic tokens, folding, formatting, diagnostics — all wired.
- **Run configurations** with toggles for `-f`/`-x`/`-v`/`--disasm`/
  `--dump-ast` and a compat-mode picker (`zsh` / `bash` / `ksh` /
  `posix` / default `zshrs`).
- **Debugger** over DAP TCP socket: line breakpoints from the gutter,
  step over/into/out/pause, frames panel with source navigation,
  variables panel (scalars + arrays + assoc arrays), Evaluate dialog,
  Console streaming program stdout in real time.
- **Reflection tool window** (right edge) — left-click any name to open
  the ANSI-rendered `zshrs --docs <name>` card.
- **Settings → Tools → zshrs** — point at a non-PATH `zshrs` binary, set
  LSP extra args + env, configure file extensions, control auto-restart.

Requires a paid JetBrains IDE on 2024.2+ (RustRover, IDEA Ultimate,
GoLand, PyCharm Pro, WebStorm, RubyMine, PhpStorm, CLion, Rider,
DataGrip, Aqua) because the platform LSP API is not in Community
editions.

### Other LSP / DAP clients

The stdio LSP and TCP DAP servers are protocol-conformant — any
LSP/DAP client works:

```toml
# Helix — ~/.config/helix/languages.toml
[language-server.zshrs]
command = "zshrs"
args = ["--lsp"]

## [0x0D] NATIVE RUST PLUGINS

Every shell before zshrs runs plugins as interpreted scripts. zshrs is
the first JIT-compiled Unix shell, and the first that **hosts plugins written
in a native compiled language** (Rust), loaded at runtime with no
recompile of the shell. A plugin is an ordinary `cdylib` the shell
`dlopen`s through a stable, versioned **C ABI** (the
[`znative`](znative/) crate). Nothing about Rust's unstable
layout, allocator, or panic ABI crosses the boundary — only
`#[repr(C)]` data.

```rust
// src/lib.rs — crate-type = ["cdylib"], deps: znative
use znative::{declare_plugin, Args, Host};
use std::os::raw::c_int;

fn rhello(host: &Host, args: &Args) -> c_int {
    let pwd = host.getvar("PWD").unwrap_or_default();
    host.print(&format!("hello, {} (pwd={pwd})\n", args.rest().join(" ")));
    0
}

declare_plugin! {
    name: "hello",
    version: "0.1.0",
    builtins: { "rhello" => rhello },
}
```

```bash
cargo build                              # → target/debug/libhello.dylib (.so on Linux)

# Inside zshrs:
zmodload -R ./target/debug/libhello.dylib   # load
zmodload -R                                  # list loaded plugins
rhello world                                 # native command, no fork, no interpreter
zmodload -uR hello                           # unload by name
```

Plugin commands resolve after real builtins and shell functions, before
PATH lookup — the same slot zsh uses for `zmodload -ab` autoloaded
builtins. The host API a plugin can call back through: `print`, `eval`
(run shell code), `getvar` / `setvar` (shell scalars), `getfunction` /
`addfunction` (read a function's deparsed body / define one — also
deparse-as-a-service), and `register_builtin`.

### Installing plugins with `znative`

`zmodload -R` is the primitive; **`znative`** is the package manager built
on it. One line per plugin in your `.zshrc` — it installs on the first
shell start (clone → `cargo build --release` for native plugins →
`zmodload -R`) and then loads from a content-addressed store, zero-network,
every start after:

```bash
znative load MenkeTechnologies/zshrs-forgit    # native (Rust) plugin, self-installing
znative load zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions     # zsh script plugins work too
```

Sources also take `github:owner/repo`, `git+URL@ref`, and `path:DIR`.
Manage the store with `znative list` / `info` / `update` / `remove`. Full
reference: [`docs/ZNATIVE.md`](docs/ZNATIVE.md).

Plugins can also provide **native (Rust) completions** — a
`completions:` block in `declare_plugin!` wires a Rust generator into
zsh's completion system (compsys), so `mycmd <TAB>` runs your Rust code to
produce candidates. See [`examples/plugin-complete/`](examples/plugin-complete/).

**Porting existing zsh plugins:** [`docs/PORTING_ZSH_PLUGIN.md`](docs/PORTING_ZSH_PLUGIN.md)
is a construct-by-construct zsh→Rust guide, worked end-to-end on
[**forgit**](examples/plugin-forgit/) (the git+fzf plugin, ported
command-for-command: `ga glo gd gcf gclean gss gcp grh gi`) and — for the
harder *self-reentrant* case — [**git-fuzzy**](examples/plugin-git-fuzzy/)
(fzf calling back into the tool per keystroke, with a `--listen` live-reload
watcher).

### vs bash / zsh native plugins

Native runtime plugins aren't new — bash `enable -f file.so name` and zsh
`zmodload` both load native builtins. The difference is the *interface*:

|                    | script plugin (`.zsh`) | bash `enable -f` / zsh module | zshrs Rust plugin |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Artifact           | `.zsh` (interpreted) | `.so` built in the shell's tree | `.dylib`/`.so` `cdylib` |
| Build against      | nothing (sourced) | the shell's **private** internal headers | published `znative` crate |
| Stable ABI         | n/a | **none** — welded to one shell build, no version gate | versioned, load-time checked |
| Distribution       | a file to source | rebuild per shell release | one crates.io SDK crate |
| Speed              | interpreted | native | native |
| Third-party viable | yes (scripts only) | **rare** (needs shell source) | **yes** (`cargo add`) |

bash and zsh load native code only through their **internal** C APIs — you
compile against the shell's private headers, with no stable ABI and no
version gate, so a plugin is welded to one build and can crash a
mismatched one. That's why neither has meaningful third-party native
plugins. zshrs exposes a stable, published, versioned ABI (`cargo add
znative`), version-gated at load — first shell to make its
native-plugin interface an independently-published ABI package instead of
its own build-tree internals.

A runnable example lives in [`examples/plugin-hello/`](examples/plugin-hello/).

twenty-nine entries, each filtered by three tests: it exists in

same document lists what was cut and why, including claims that
did not survive a prior-art check. The synthesis it covers
(compiled-shell architecture with both bytecode and native code
persisted, recorder-owns-rebuild AOP intercept, purity analysis
splitting cacheable config from replayed config, the singleton
daemon owning every mutation, session-persistent supervised jobs
with bidirectional ptmx attach, cross-shell pub/sub + named-lock
builtins, bytecode-level value lineage, AOP advice as a shell
primitive, a stable published plugin ABI) is prior art for the
shell-design commons under the MIT grant.
Future shells — bash, fish, nushell, elvish, oil, xonsh, murex,
projects that don't exist yet — should inherit any of it. The
